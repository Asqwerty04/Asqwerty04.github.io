«Heretic!" – told church."Hooligan!" – officials told. «Shameless person!" – petty bourgeoises told. And Nevzorov answered with the next venomous column. A legend early the ninetieth, it returned to the dear public better than former: replaced a leather jacket with a suit, a cigarette on a tube, young rage – on bitter irony of a maturity. Only reaction to its texts is invariable:"It what, scoffs, perhaps?!" About is not present, it it is absolute it is serious. He heals wounds and castigates defects, speaks about God and the person, Russia and America, religion and history. Before you – the book of Alexander Nevzorov who hides the tragic squint behind malicious, shameless and absolutely intolerable smile.

To offend art
The shortest abstract of series of lectures in Erart1 I ask to note that I do not call for anything. Moreover, I would not like that someone shared my views. Mass has to remain mass, and piece – piece. There is a set of representations which should not become standard at all. In given конспектик I picked at random the most different fragments of the lectures. Their general subject – absolute free-thinking and, as a result, skill of journalism. And it sometimes needs very exotic illustrations. Naturally, in this quality I use subjects and images, the most clear to my listeners. Why absolute free-thinking is necessary? Certainly, it do not aim though sometimes and allows to enjoy a neobolvanennost. It – the tool without which there is no sense to go in for neither journalism, nor science. The policy was, is and will be fine material for working off of skills of mockery. Especially in this quality the political reality of the Russian Federation is good. It is so juicy also a marazmatichna that it is difficult to imagine the best exercise machine. Of course, a hooligan liberty of the address with it the invoice comes only in that case when you are absolutely free in general from any political views. So, we will consider events of the last month. The national erection which was so long caused by the Kremlin at last came true. At the same time there was also a question it further application. But! The accepting body at Syria was is insignificant is small, at Donbass is mined, and to the Baltics devil's NATO managed to fasten a chastity belt. The spare option with Belarus failed too. There everything was so strong hammered with potato that there was no place to put eregirovanny Russian greatness. What now to do with this erection, it is clear to nobody. Sooner or later to the Kremlin again it is necessary to knock teeth about a glass, reminding "to brothers and to sisters" about magic opportunities of palms. This disgusting moment comes. The public missed great power statehood, that is fronts, torture chambers and cards. She wants in shackles and under lashes. And the Kremlin in commodity quantity has no those. Except the show "walking cemetery", he has nothing to offer the population. Until the last minute the hope for revival of torment traditions glimmered. But, as it became clear, at most, what can count society on, is a torture by a concert from foolish ruins. Rosstat suppresses figure umuchenny violoncellos so far, but hardly it can impress successors of GULAG. Both obscurantist, and liberal analysts – in terrible concern. They sniff at press allocations of each other and with popugaysky persistence diagnose "a fascism virus", "revolution" and "russophobia" for opponents. They always on a tear, to them it is always painful. Of course, the landscape would be decorated by catafalques, but, unfortunately, for the fatherland none of analysts died of pain yet. They whine, but agree and farther to be one of monstrik on a wild cloth Russia. Alas, nobody wants to separate and see a plague charm of a situation. They not are able to perceive the country as grandiose dissecting room where on each table meanings and rare entities, ready to preparation, are spread out. Analysts peremorochil to the heads the lamentations about "fatherland", "people", "morals", etc. These encumbrances, of course, are lovely, but they deprive of an opportunity to think clearly.

It is necessary to get rid of them first of all. However, as well as from any political views and addictions. The publicist loaded with these concepts reminds the anatomist who goes in prozektorsky not to cut, and to sob. It is better not to have any homeland, than to cultivate some rubbish in this quality. Just because "so it turned out" and "mother". It is not necessary to stand the mad old woman who smothers grandsons and sets fire to portieres. One pro-gate of the globe demonstrates that the choice возмоzhny "homeland" it is rather big.1

***
About "people" it is necessary to forget, as well as about respect for its "choice". That fact that audience"Psychic Challenge", krichatel of "krymnash" and vypivatel of one billion bottles of vodka chose to themselves idols, should not oblige to anything. Political preferences of this public have the same value, as well as them интеллектуальny or cultural addictions.2 The concept "people" is only a part of the primitive propaganda material, composed mode. Both priests broadcast on behalf of "god", and the modes on behalf of "people". And the mention the power of this slippery concept says only that it stakes on the most primitive properties of the population.

***
In other words, it is never necessary to miss opportunities to mock at the power. For this purpose it is possible to use any pretext and if it is absent, then it is necessary to create it. And the wipe of legs about various shrines is the most important part of a profession of the publicist. However, a variety of shrines obliges also to a variety of soles. The majority of shrines are poisonous and demand a strong protector on boots. Unfortunately, the act of the Russian Federation deprived of us a pleasant opportunity to offend feelings of believers. But remained still it is a lot of any "sakralnost" which by the nonsense concede nothing religions. For example, traditions, ideologies and patriotism. At the same time it is not necessary to be afraid to damage someone's beliefs. The real patriot will never refuse the confidence that rabbits live in the conjurer's hat.

***
By the way. Quality of thinking can make also literal practical sense. Let's remember Jeremiah Bentam. This thinker, impudent for the time, was mummified. The chest with its remains was placed in the hall of the London university college. But over time around Bentam's relics mysterious events began. The chest cover was removed next morning. At night in the hall glass fought and strange sounds were registered. As it became clear, one of laboratory assistants, Mr. Mill, was moved to collect "something like oil, following from Bentam's head". Mr. Mill explained that this substance in the best way is suitable for lubricant of laboratory chronometers. A number of experiences confirmed that "oil" is valid out of competition.

Certainly, it does not concern those situations when very big inheritance in the long term looms. Then it is possible to suffer even portieres. 2 Tabout is zero.

Certainly, the assumption of communication between Bentam's intelligence and quality of lubricant for chronometers is an absolute nonsense. But, as well as any nonsense, this history can serve as a fine allegory of how the head scientist serves science.

Sometimes there are amusing remarks from audience. In particular, the question of what work of fiction influenced me in the childhood sounded. I honestly answered that, most likely, "A crime and the NACzaniye" which me was persuaded1 to read. I was small and still it was not able to be protected from all this waste paper. But from this book certain the sense nevertheless was. I well acquired that, having largely behaved disgracefully, it is never necessary to be tormented. "Remorse" most often also leads to exposure. They significantly distort behavior and as a result lead to "puncture".

Kirill is the educator of penguins, or Istina not subgrated back
I
The Antarctic sermon of Gundyaev made undoubted success: sixteen penguins accepted Orthodoxy. Possibly, now it is necessary to change a habitual title for new: Patriarch of Moscow and Vsey Pingvinov. But business at all not in the new statuses. All much strategichny. The miracle about penguins was shown "to Russian miru" "in a consolation", and also for prevention of possible split of church after a sit-round gathering in Cuba. Emergency measures of precaution are clear. In principle, "Russian mir" in February could become torn on thousands of sects. Let's explain. Still recently the bosom of ROC seemed eternal and cozy. But the Cuban feint ears crossed out everything. The most important traditions of Orthodoxy, in fact, were marked by Gundyaev as amusing misunderstanding, and beliefs of the honored Russian Saints – as nonsense. To give smacking kiss alive a papal lasta, of course, it did not turn out, but, as we know, kisses happen also "air". Orthodoxy with all his haters of "Latin heresy", like Theodosius of the Caves and Ioann Kronstadt, was "merged" for a couple of hours of a lovely conversation. As soon as the sacrament of big discharge came to the end, the corresponding button was pressed and in turtles of church functionaries earned motors. Their hum said that in Cuba there was "a meeting of the millennium" full incomprehensible to mind of meanings. The event was given the official status of "fertile". It became clear that if necessary it will be possible to justify merge of ROC even with a cult Voodoo. But! No shocks and splits occurred. Monasteries did not flare, and did not vozgremet chains of martyrs. Orthodox weight just did not notice a collapse of thousand-year tradition of the belief. At first the opingvinivaniye trick worked, and then pilgrims were distracted by the nurse and other labutena.

In near last considerably smaller corrections of a church course flooded the country with blood. With self-immolation and distempers orthodox Russia answered insignificant changes of the spiritual traditions. And here the global trick of Kirill did not make on Orthodox Christians in general any impression. Of course, it was not without polemics in smoking-rooms of seminaries. But there only one question was discussed: whether the truth the fact that at a historical meeting Francis sat in flippersah, carefully covered with a cassock?1 The envious concern of seminarists was caused also by redness of a patriarchal nose, that, however, easily is explained by the Cuban heat and rum. Nose and flippers … For flock which once easily killed and died for a way of addition of fingers, it, of course, unpresentably. Degradation is obvious, but the reason it it is simple. Religious belief today – the phenomenon purely decorative. Of course, it still it is suitable as a reason for denunciations, riots and rudeness, but it contents by "believer" is absolutely indifferent. Possibly, it is possible to rewrite iconostases, having replaced physiognomies of Saints with faces of penguins. Buntov will not follow. The pious public will render thanks the administration and will be touched to klyuvika. Orthodoxy exhausted. Anything surprising. Even killing uranium over time the trance mutates in chemically boring lead.

However, among the gone-out flock of ROC there are also exceptions. Neopenguinёnny already swallowed tears, and now rush about and cry out: where now to save the soul? Their torments, of course, are justified. But poor fellows want to be consoled. The market of religious services is big and various. And ways of rescue of soul are presented on it in the widest assortment. There are luxury techniques, and there are also quite decent samples house-keeper of a class. There is dense antiquity, and there is also an abrupt modernism. Of course, the believing person prefers the most ancient ways, fairly believing that the more ignorantly and growing dull there was an inventor of "dushespaseniye", the it is more than truth in its technique. It is the correct approach to a problem. Conviction in existence of soul – an indispensable component of savage representations and primitive thinking. Only anything not turbid primitiveness gives rise to original spirituality. Not incidentally during an era of early Christianity "veris ani intersi" was so appreciated that is translated as "the truth not subgrated back". Let's explain sense of this beautiful term which can be used as in direct, and figuratively. For permission of doctrinal or world outlook disputes some famous hermit was always invited. Let's note that insanitation of the aged man was the best testimony of his spirituality. Certainly, effective chains mattered too. But original participation in god and the truth nevertheless was determined by degree is dirtiedNawns. Let's follow this pious logic. Wishing to find the best way of "rescue of soul", we should choose from all bums of world history most not subgrated. It- that opinion will also be the most authoritative. The competition is very high here. It would not be desirable to upset patriots, but their team – in outsiders. Of course, and the Russian church can brag of nonsense, wildness and insanitary

conditions of the teachers. But … but in this genre there are samples more impressive. And much more ancient. Respectively, and it is better to eat ways of rescue, than repeating over and again forehead about a floor or chewing of meat of god. With them it is necessary to examine, make the choice – and forever to dismiss flippers and a red nose. The technique is surprisingly graceful seaside dayak. Their shamans tie a set of fishing hooks to fingers of hands. At the time of separation of soul from a body – they dexterously cut it, hook and drag. But! At the same time they so shout and bang in tambourines that still any ethnographer did not manage to catch the answer to the question of destiny of the caught soul. Of course, it is not as offensive as a full iconostasis of penguins, but uncertainty depresses. At nationality guide the situation is better. Their sorcerers use a big hollow bone in which they cork the got lost or flown away souls. At different savages of a technique of a dushespaseniye significantly differ. Why? The matter is that there is no consensus even about dislocation of soul in a human body. Theologians with a bone in a nose cannot agree with theologians in miters. Papuans, parapsychologists, kafra and bible Jews are sure that it is in blood. Tasmaniytsa, Bushmen and orthodox philosophers determined by the place it dwellings heart. Tribes овамбо, Platon and Eskimos had to a shower in a breast and a liver, and platonik found still one,1 concealed in lumbar and sacral department of a backbone. According to ancient Lombards, the soul having an appearance of a snake lives in intestines, and at Koryaks it it is possible to observe on the top in the form of a small spark. This uncertainty complicates rescue business. But, fortunately Zulus invented the method reconciling all contradictions. These great people ceased to eat cigarettes quite recently and learned their true mission. Being in the lead in spirituality, Zulus jealously treat soul and it to rescue. They developed the procedure for which only five drums, bags and the smoking shed are necessary. The iconostasis, chalices and domes are not required. How the saving ordinance comes true? "The successor of the dead cuts off a part of his genitals from a corpse, cuts the left hand on pieces, cuts a lower lip and cuts out a piece of skin from the middle of a forehead. It smokes all this on fire, and then having sewn upat in sacks of different size".2 Process takes several days. Is followed by squeal and a drumbeat. If during smoking the rhythm of all five drums was sustained correctly, then both rescue, and almost unlimited period of storage is provided to soul. Participation of penguins in a ceremony is not provided.

blood. Will weigh, will measure and will make couple of ukolchik. And then will load into formalin. The become empty skull will be fastened with self-tapping screws. The scalp will be dressed back and will brush on a parting at the side. So when the gun carriage zatarakhtit on a stone blocks, in the great head already there will be line. In few weeks formalin will make the business. Hemispheres will get a pleasant rezinovost and will become suitable for studying. Anything extraordinary. It happens to a brain of each noticeable character of both local, and world history. Of course, on opening pale lieutenants are not always on duty, but the procedure is invariable. Dictators, scientists, writers, etc., as a rule, keep within a coffin already without brains. The matter is that confidence is still live: through features of crinkles, furrows and ventricles it is possible to solve that "the genius and plainness" that distinguished the owner of this body from other homo. It is rather fresh tendency. To it no more than two centuries. Certainly, earlier everything was in a different way. Our grandfathers highly appreciated a brain of the person. In the basis of a skull the hole convenient for a prolezaniye of a paw, capture and eating of all polusharny substrata broke. But when time of pithecanthropi passed and customs coarsened, began to shake out a brain without anything gastronomic1 applications. In particular, the Egyptians liking to dry and paint the dead men acted this way. The bible, certainly, did not know about a role of this body, and other antichnik believed that in a skull the same substance, as well as in any other bone settles down. However, it is unlikely it makes sense to list all to a funny nature of which history of comprehension of a brain consists. Each new era aspired nonsense to eclipse previous. But! Several freaks, despite sneers, fires and damnations, nevertheless managed to understand a role of a brain and to connect the of understanding in system. The works they created a chain of statements of the increasing accuracy in time. It was the long and laborious process which was roughly destroying mass representations. As a result next paradoxical "phase transition" came true. The opinion of units broke beliefs of hundreds of millions and became standard. The mankind agreed that it is obliged by the progress to a brain. First all this amused and admired. There was a brain cult. But soon the cult was unhooked from reality and began to lead the glossy life. Wandering according to editions, it adjoins to buttocks of models and together with them gets prettier. Today the glamourous image of "hemispheres with strelochka" finally forced out scientific understanding, factual and the major theories. Why it occurred? The matter is that scientific knowledge here again squabbled with culture doctrines. Certainly, won against the myth about uniqueness of the person, and knowledge buried in boring monographs. Let's it dig out and we will look: and in what it consists? First of all that a brain of the person – the ordinary product of the evolutionary conveyor not so suitable for "masterpiece". This brain house-keeper of a class, extremely limited in the opportunities. What, however, is not surprising. It was made for ensuring simple needs of the pithecanthropus. For the last one million years in this brain something atrophied, and something developed. But all on trifles. "Class", certainly, did not exchange.

Owner of such brain it is doomed on defective perception of events and the phenomena. His sense organs do not perceive an infrasound, ultrasound, the polarized light, magnetism and all a lookы electromagnetic radiation.1 Events of all levels of a microcosm, and also diffraction, electroreception and active are inaccessible to it sanitation, the allocating part of animals "sound vision" etc. we Will be frank: this brain something reminds a knee. From the person at least three quarters of the major natural phenomena are hidden. It is similar to the blind and deaf little fool in the Disneyland over which fireworks are broken off and everything sparkles around, bawls, rattles and dances. And our little fool is sure that goes in silence, on a gray, empty corridor of clinic. In comparison with a true picture of the world our space is colourless and primitive. For example: matter of the environment is sated with the brightest electromagnetic incidents. They tear apart, sew reality. But in a brain of the person there are no substrata which could register and make it a part of consciousness. Yes, there were devices allowing the person to see a part of what is hidden from his direct perception. But it is only compensators. Let's explain. Stone cut lack of normal claws and teeth, and massspektrometra and microscopes – brain shortcomings compensated homo. Let's note that this compensation is short-term and available only to units. It, in fact, changes nothing as acquaints only with the separate phenomena. There is no device which it could compensate at the same time and symphonically to the person all what it is deprived.2 Also it is necessary to remember that homo brain – the successor of all stages of development of nervous system of vertebrata. It hard inheritance. It constantly loads primitiveness in our behavior, but to refuse it there is no opportunity. And here command of a brain forever remained behind its most ancient structures. Let's remind that they were created during Paleozoic era when force and full value of aggressions solved almost everything, and "other" qualities were absolutely superfluous. The Paleozoic ended. Came cheerful time of pithecanthropi. It added to inheritance still and dementia, millions of years which was a standard condition of the ancient person. In all this there is no tragedy. It is only necessary to understand that illusions are inappropriate. Poor homo – it is obvious not that favourite of evolution on whom it concentrated all the efforts. Of course, prisoner in our skull the resource allowed to calculate an alpha constant and Planck's temperature. It impresses. But there is a suspicion that bases for pride a little. Let's remember with what work these heights were given to mankind. Process of their comprehension "from here to here" took 5 thousand years. But so many efforts were required not because the phenomena are so difficult. Most likely, they are obvious and primitive. Constraint of their opening is explained only by low "technical" characteristics of a brain of openers. As we see, knowledge of history of a brain closes a question of its "mysterious" potentials. Nevertheless romantics continue search of a material substratum of "genius". Scientific institutes for years beat the air, trying to discover tendency to leadership or an oratorical gift in marinated brains.

Except visible light. Let's note that the fact of emergence of instrument compensators is the best proof of that, information which was how hidden from a brain was necessary for the person.

Great villains of the 20th century were investigated with special care. The exception was made by Stalin. As soon as at "the father of the people" the difalliya was posthumously confirmed, interest in its crinkles evaporated, and all attention concentrated on rare ugliness. To the word. The dvuglavost of own penis only pleased Iosif Vissarionovich. Small crowns, ribbons and the coats of arms were secretly made. In the evenings Stalin created juicy compositions, inviting a near circle to behold and be touched. By the way, the diagnosis "paranoia" was made to it by Bekhterev when Coba, sparkling and reddening, showed "design" to the old psychiatrist. With other maniacs the situation was not better. Chikatilo's brain was hopelessly it is spoiled. The ensigns who were carrying out "tower" overdid and ripped Andrey Romanovich's head to shreds. Other serial murderer, Theodor Bundy, could not offer the hemispheres to science too. They cooked in his skull when the sheriff tested extreme power of a prison electrochair for Bundy. His sentimental father forbade to withdraw a brain of the eviscerator Dammer, and here the maniac Wayne of mozgoved pleased. Withdrawal came true accurately and in time. But no distinctions between brain substance of Wayne and the known standards were found. With Lenin was still more funny. Ilyich's brain was it is turned in 30 thousand medicines. 50 years toiled at them 400 neuromorphologists, histologists and molecular biologists. 13 professors so overtired that they went to medicines. Two were shot, and six went mad finally. One of gone mad was it is caught colleagues in eating of micromedicines of a lateral cranked body of a brain of Lenin. Over Ilyich's hemispheres hundreds of hysterics, and the general engine capacity of the shed tears not burst gives in to the account. CENTRAL COMMITTEE All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks), Narkomzdrav of the USSR and personally companion Stalin demanded identification though some uniqueness more and more categorically every year. Same also the mature Soviet power wanted. The academician Sarkisov who directed researches all structure of a special department of the Central Committee persuaded to find "though something". But, as the final conclusion said, "… the main features of a brain of V. I. Lenin are typical for almost every third brain". These data, certainly, were long secret. And then became interesting to nobody. But stubborn homo does not want to leave the dream. So the cerebral comedy will repeat also to lieutenants again it is necessary to jam a limonchik an emetic reflex. The expected result will not be. The genius substratum, certainly, will not be found. What, however, will not prevent the owner of the next "great" head to take place with comfort in the Mausoleum in any way. To move Ilyich not it is necessary, as the Mausoleum – an institution double. And at desire will be located there and still couple of maniacs, including the owner of a two-headed penis.

Million years of weak-mindedness

The religious belief can be compared to integumentary wool. At the first stages of evolution dense, grease wool on the person was quite pertinent. It heated it, protected and provided lung breakfast: in it thickets it was always possible to catch high-calorie parasites. But there passed several million years, and process of a razvoloseniye began. At first from a dirty koltun the naked physiognomy seemed. Then there came the era of the general baldness of the person. Evolution

11

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

inevitably exempted it from integumentary wool, from it edible inhabitants and sweet of constant rippling. Of course, it was very cruel. But there was no place to disappear. It was necessary to grow bald as, having slightly ascended on a scale of ranks, homo got access to large drop. To hulks of big dead animals. And this product demanded deep immersion. The liquid and semi-fluid putrefactive substrata which are contained in it impregnated wool and finally turned our greatgrandfathers into a walking garbage can. So the razvoloseniye of the person occurred for the same reason, as a neck exposure at signature stamps. But a signature stamp – a bird delicate. It deeply in drop did not climb and therefore kept the most part of plumage. And here homo became bare almost completely. Perhaps, everything occurred not absolutely as it is represented to me. But it and is not important. For any of several reasons the person got rid of cozy integumentary wool. And it appeared it is extremely useful for its development, reproduction and survival. Approximately the same had to happen also to integumentary wool of his mind, to religious belief. Once for primitive savage thinking it was natural and comfortable. It warmed and gave chesatelny sweet of a prayer. In it pleasantly itching beliefs were got. But in process of change of the intellectual environment this "wool" had to disappear too. Nevertheless it did not occur. Still it carry 90% of people. This "wool" is tinted, twisted and cut according to religious fashion and local culture. Of course, on it there can be big or small bald spots, but nevertheless, contrary to all laws of development, in general it remains. At it hundreds of names: cabbala, Orthodoxy, Shintoism, Buddhism, Islam, metaphysics, etc. But, despite a set names and colors, this uniform phenomenon having one nature and one appointment. The attributes of cults are various, but sense at them the general: existence of external management of the world. This "wool" shreds was torn out by science and the journalism pulled out. But it grew as in what did not happen. At last the quantum mechanics prepared reality. In it to depth a set of the physical phenomena generating all visible and invisible matter was found. Certainly, there also did not smell of any "external management". But "wool" easily endured also it. Cultivating rage and the bans, it always frankly interfered with development of the person. On it sublimation precious centuries were for nothing spent. It started the "social" elevators uplifting in the power of the most primitive representatives of a look. It is obvious and it uselessness: any repeatings over and again forehead in a floor before a symbol of any deity are at least ineffectual. According to all laws of development, about belief there would have to be only amusing memoirs. But this "wool" is not going to get down, and still defines outlook of vast majority of people. Mass character of religious belief does not prove it validity or necessity. It is possible to take 200 000 000 ducks and to learn them at the same time to grunt at the sight of an inflatable ball. Duck unanimity, of course will make shock impression. But it will be not the proof of extraordinary properties of a ball, and more likely the characteristic of ducks. In other words, the mystery of belief should be looked for where it also is: in radical features of homo. That is where our knowledge are already defective, and thanks to efforts of anthropology and psychology become worse every year. The matter is that for understanding of the phenomenon it is necessary to know its origin. Fundamental qualities of the person were created during that era when the concept "save the ass" was used in direct, but not figuratively. The so-called "prehistoric" period was the most long and important for our look. Then decided what to be to the person. All mechanism of our higher

12

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

nervous activity – a fruit of that period when homo was the gregarious animal trading in search of drop and a cannibalism. For several million years all specific habits, features of behavior and biological habits were put and fixed. All main qualities of the person it is from that era. Including that property that induces to kiss boards with pictures or to cut off the heads to gyaura. Tell about a consequence of this period also figures: the so-called "prehistoric" period is at least 200 thousand generations, and so-called "historical" – only 200. Let's notice that the biology teaches us to the fact that each organism is the fluctuating sum of properties of all his predecessors. All that предъявthe fixed history lyat to us,1 – it is a trifle. By that moment as there was writing, homo finally developed and only realized the features. It is necessary to understand that the powdered wig or a helmet with a star was put not on by someone, and the great-grandson of the pithecanthropus, the successor of all properties of this lovely being. He reflected on gravitation, built pyramids and clanked with doors of gas chambers. Image of the burner of witches, military murderer, eternal tyrant, sophisticated the executioner badly matches the humanistic concept of evolution of the person. But it is worth remembering that rapes, murders and all derivatives of these entertainments were the main business of the person during many millions of years, – and at once everything falls into place. However, we have no ambitions to characterize all way of this bright animal. Our task is much simpler: to understand what properties of the person still keep integumentary wool on his mind. As arose and what the religious belief, more or less clear was made of. I will remind, that is not the question, and in those deep qualities of homo which provided to belief amazing survivability. Therefore, we should go down on a chronological scale on two-three of millions of years and to peer into cunning eyes of our great-grandfathers. And here problems begin. We have nobody to ask for the help and the facts. As it becomes clear, not the fundamental science, but a certain descriptive discipline, infused on imaginations and dangerously adjoining on graceful literature is engaged in evolution of the person. From the moment of establishment of the Nobel Prize there passed 115 years. The medal with a profile of a nice dinamitchik became the main criterion of so-called "scientific character". Certainly, those who did not get it not always agree with it and will not get. But today there is no more authoritative registrar of reliability and importance of knowledge, than Alfred Nobel's award. Of course, the Nobel committee was not always faultless in the estimates of "a personal contribution" scientists. Sometimes, that it offended great and glorified insignificant. However, it concerned only a personnel. Directly disciplines expanding knowledge of the Universe and it contents, were regularly showered with the Nobel gold. The digestion physiology, relic radiation, genetics and quantum mechanics always received what was due to them by right. Certainly, works of committee had also boomerang effect. The "Nobel" circle outside which there was everything that has no relation to original science was outlined. Delineation was made "painfully, but is accurate". There was no kindling of cross-disciplinary discord in the spirit of Rutherford claiming that "the science is divided into physics and into collecting of brands". Division into "the real sciences", "not really sciences" and "at all not sciences" came true as by itself. Without declarations. Through unshakable and consecutive suppression of attempts of "small knowledge" to make the way in the main circle. As good illustration serves the example of so-called "psychoanalysis". Eleven times it moved forward the admirers on an award and as much time was it is rejected. Astrologers, historians,

anthropologists, linguists of etc. too more than once contemplated an ice smile of the Nobel committee returning their works "as not having relations to fundamental science". So, the sentence sounded long ago. In 2009 an attempt to appeal against it and to allow "not absolutely sciences" to consideration of Royal academy by the commissions was made. But initiators of this idea politely flogged, and closed a subject. Let's especially note that by default it is accepted to spare feelings of representatives of "small knowledge" and to call as seldom as possible things by their proper names. Moreover, to anybody in the head not will come to sneer aloud at their glossy volumes, at their collections of stones stones and fantasy interpretations of these artifacts. It is considered that everything explains the fact of rejection of "small knowledge" in the Nobel disciplines and does not demand comments. And discordant freedom to expire poison in any quantities is provided. According to "the Nobel account" are in the category of "not sciences": astrology, ufology, psychology, linguistics, history, anthropology, archeology, chiromancy, demonology, philology, theology, sociology and still several "logiya" are younger also poskandalny. This different knowledge is connected by the general trouble. All of them are absolutely infertile. Exact historical knowledge is also impossible, as well as a call of the demon. And inexact knowledge has one small problem: it simply is not knowledge and is suitable only for an entertainment. However, we will not chafe a wound of "not sciences" once again. All this does not mean at all that the archeology is forever put in one row with ufology, and anthropology – with chiromancy. Certainly, it not so. Both at archeology, and at anthropology remains chance to become real sciences. Perhaps, these disciplines will sometime overcome "inferiority", will get own Eynshteynami and will come for Nobel's gold. Of course, this chance is illusive. But it is. Unlike demonology the anthropology, for example, nevertheless deals with reality. But whether she will learn to treat her so masterly to offer the world the conclusions equal to physics constants, – a big question.

II
Certainly, futility of anthropological researches could remain a personal record of this discipline. Strictly speaking, all it failures can cause nobody damage as do not exert any impact on processes of knowledge of the world. Of course, density of a pubic hair of Mongoloids are very important question, but, having gritted teeth, it is possible to do also without its decision. If business was limited to this and similar tasks, then nobody would disturb anthropology in it distant store-room. But! On the trouble she was an izuchatelnitsa such inflamed subjects as evolution of the person. In the middle of the 19th century Darwin, Geksli and Gekkel specified on extremely "a low biological origin" of homo. Moreover, they bequeathed to descendants to solve the nature and sense trance of mutations this animal. The anthropology volunteered to be "descendant". She very much wanted to become demanded and important science. But in 150 years she, certainly, could not understand the reasons of transformation of an animal of homo at least in the art critic. However, it is necessary to pay tribute to anthropologists. They coped with a technical part of work: dug out, washed and beautifully spread out sets of stones and stones. By means of such installations it was succeeded to designate in rough those changes which happened to a body of an animal of homo for several million years. But, as it became clear, all this has to a riddle of the person and an origin of its properties no slightest relation. Stones, certainly, do not explain the reasons of evolutionary career of homo, do

14

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

not decipher the reasons it strange staging is also not given an idea of motivation which forced this animal to change. In other words, we see full fiasco. All questions and were left without answers. Also there are no hopes that answers will appear. How so important matter appeared under the authority of so low-power discipline? The answer is simple. The real science in a question of evolution of the person has nothing to do so far. But not for the reason that the subject of studying is not interesting. And only because there is nothing to work. There are no checked facts which could be put in self-sustaining system. In that that generates large-caliber guesses, and then and opening. We see an example of such addition in physics, chemistry, physiology, biology. In anthropology of it it did not happen. For many reasons. It is difficult to believe in it, but among authors there is no anthropogenesis and there was nobody equilibrium to Planck, Bourne, Feynman, Galilei or Pavlov. For all the time of the existence this discipline did not generate any great or at least a big scientific name. The intellectual elite of mankind was never engaged in a subject of development of the person. This major question was assigned to set of "muddy grandfathers", nobody interested parties, famous outside a circle. Already 150 years these middlings write off each other conjectures about an animal who doprogressirovatsya in some magic way to a mortgage and condoms. This absence"names" it is surprising. The solution of evolution of homo promised and promises grandiose monasteries. In principle, on this question all intellectual power of Europe had to be focused. But … even the most predatory and ambitious intellectuals in it never also looked. Only for one reason. There "also did not smell of a profit". There are no facts – there is no science also, and, therefore, there is no true glory or big gold. However, where there is no science, as a rule, take roots and very amusing conjectures blossom. What, actually, also occurred. Let's remember "the theory of primitive society" which in this or that look dominates in a paleoanthropology. She imitates, changes names, makes "weather-cloths" of the advanced phraseology, but it essence remains invariable. What the theory is? Let's state it briefly and without ceremonies. It is the beautiful story about purposeful the pithecanthropus who dreamed to become a person. For the sake of it he self-improved and enigmatically passed on the experience to the next generations. In the absence of writing it was with some difficulty, but the pithecanthropus coped. Through couple of millions years it at last managed to grow up the brain to the necessary sizes. The brain became quite suitable for the invention of pants and a revolver. But our pithecanthropus continued to be over-modest and was content with a role of the gregarious animal who was darting about in search of drop. It compensated a pettiness of the situation by filosofstvovaniye at a fire, and also desperate promiscuity and a cannibalism. Possibly, it seemed to it very romantic. Periodically our hero obkolachivat stones and hid the hand-made articles in different places. So it carried out still one million years, but suddenly remembered the old, almost forgotten dream. And right there changed: covered genitals and ceased to eat relatives. This mysterious metamorphosis was also called "neolytic revolution". And it already brought the person on a home straight to Pharaohs, Mto otsarta and electric chairs. The dream at last came true. Certainly, so frank rubbish has to have and very amusing roots. Let's look. Also we will easily find these roots in "cave" entertaining novels of the beginning of the XX century of Zh. Roni "Fight for fire", "A cave lion" and Vamirekh; in stories Д’Эрвильи and Claude Senak. There in caves beauties sob, and heroes wave cudgels and in every possible way encourage tool and social progress.

15

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

It is obvious that Vamirekh's cudgel specified anthropology a development vector. That obeyed and obediently went in the specified direction. Let's remind that with intellectuals in this discipline it was always bad. To critically comprehend the falseness imposed by culture and to rise against it there was nobody. As a result of this sad combination of circumstances works of pillars of anthropology are Veynertov-Alekseevykh-Zubovykh-Gyunterov-Nesturkhov, etc., in fact, are ozanudlenny retelling of fiction Д’Эрвильи and Ronistarshego. And anything else. How there could be such embarrassment? Very simply. The tragicomedy of "small knowledge" began at the end of the 19th century when scientists misters-anthropologists Zimmerman, Vayts, Klaach, Wound, etc. were delivered of early studies of phylogeny of homo. They managed to collect practically all nonsenses and tales about "antediluvian inhabitants of the planet" and to state them with the academic pathos. Publications of these works inspired fiction writers on creation of already literary images of cave people. Naturally, "primitive" novels were written on curves of love and heroic dramas. It is not difficult to notice that all "vamirekh" and "gammla" are standard types of a boulevard genre of the beginning of the XX century. They think, act and long for its laws. Of course, they are dressed in skins, lit up by fires and can gnaw a bone. But on nose bridges of these pithecanthropi traces of eye-glasses are noticeable. The "cave" subject was victorious and quickly took the book market and mass media. The romantic savage Vamirekh began to roar from all newspaper strips and covers. Certainly, painters and sculptors right there took advantage of the opportunity. In forcing of falseness artists managed to outdo even writers. Opening days were filled with "men of courage of the Stone Age". Brushes and Kunert, Febvre, Kremye's cutters and others quickly created the necessary esthetics, and that easily generated a stereotype of "hero hunter" and ancient progressionist. The stereotype became mass and easily was fixed: the brave dreamer with a cudgel quite met the most strict requirements to "great-grandfather". It was not a shame to have such ancestor, he did not destroy the narcissistic myth of culture, and even added to it a piquancy. Young and still very sickly anthropology could not resist against the highly experienced monster of culture and "laid down under him". In other words, the culture here again knocked out science, having imposed it absolutely false image of the ancient person. Certainly, fell under influence of a cultural stereotype to a slathe blowing generation of anthropologists.1 It began to serve a stereotype – and "the dog has a snack the tail". Eternal rotation of anthropogenesis around fiction of boulevard novelists began. The circle became isolated. As a result, there was "a theory of primitive society" made not of the facts, and of opinions and inventions. "small knowledge" is also not capable to answer on this reason on one question, including what is considered by us. Certainly, there is nobody to blame here, we see accident. But all this most stupid history keeps the influence till present. Poor Vamirekh continues to be milked in hope for what from him at last will be dug by the scientific truth. Of course, nobody encroaches on the sacred right to remain the fool. But let anthropologists stare in the podoynik. Who knows, maybe, will occur miracle: it will be filled with constants, and the Nobel committee recognizes anthropology as science. However, that it it is not yet there are advantages too. We acquire the right "to walk on buffet, in what without refusing to itself". Where there are no constants, there cannot be also mistakes.

III
To resolve our issue, certainly, it is necessary to sweep out first of all from a subject all semantic garbage which is saved up by anthropology in 150 years. Including also "vamirekh", and specific terminology. It is good only for creation of the "smoke screen" hiding futility of this discipline. Possibly, the true story of early homo was absolutely another and developed by absolutely other principles, than the anthropology believes. However it we never learn details. Of course, is raskopochny"to floor facts" and hints, but the quantity them is insignificant, and emptiness between them are huge. It is necessary to have courage to leave emptiness emptiness, but not to fill them with imaginations and speculation. However, not all so hopelessly. We have something. We can objectively and precisely define "an intellectual condition" of the ancient person. Having made it, we will easily calculate also some its fundamental properties.1 To learn what was the being who died one million years ago we can by the principle of an exception. Through idle time calculation what it was deprived. Full transfer of what was not known to the pithecanthropus – senseless business. It practically all the person "is made" of. And it concerns not quanta and not Pavlov's works at all. No, speech goes about the elementary knowledge and concepts obligatory for each person. So, we take generalized character of the person also we begin to subtract from it a position behind a position. Having deducted everything that early homo just could not know, we will receive the being who is falling short even of normal weak-mindedness. With the corresponding habits and behavior. It is also our great-grandfather. We will see that its "the intellectual capital" is much less, than at eternal prisoners of regime psychiatric clinics. Nevertheless, judging by the huge duration of "a prehistoric era", the pithecanthropus in his dementnost it was quite cozy. And here the first experiences of thinking had to hurt it almost, destroying comfort habitual a bezmysliya. The pithecanthropus is not guilty. It also could not be another. But for millions of years weakmindedness was absorbed in a look and became one of TsNS operating modes. Its function – protection against the discomfort caused by development. Over time it got prettier and became very influential force which provided the person with a set of simple pleasures. It is probable including religious belief. Each victory of weak-mindedness over development was gilded by culture, obligingly turning the next nonsense into an object of "the world heritage" and "a civilization milestone". Simple example – pyramids of Egypt. In fact, it is the first visible symbol of a celebration of weak-mindedness. Their construction meant that the future of mankind will be defined in many respects by its dementny past. Let's explain. After the mysterious "neolytic revolution" homo got off in large packs. There was an inevitable socialization. it writing and accumulation of practical experience of the address with stones, clay, a tree, metal, etc turned out to be consequence. The Egyptian era refined and aggravated this primary set of knowledge. It, for the first time in the history of a look, united these technologies with efforts of hundreds of thousands of people and as a result erected pyramids. But why she made it? What the huge constructions which cost thousands of hernias and death were necessary for? As it became clear, putting in them a couple dried dead men.

Perhaps, among them that that allows religious belief to remain so far was overlooked.

Perhaps, this coincidence, but such approach it is very characteristic of a clinical picture of dementia. The feeble-minded patient, having seized some new skill or a subject, as a rule, thinks out for him the most idiotic application. Annals of psychiatry keeps memory of Salpetriyer's prisoner, mild and silent Alain Morson. He stood well and sometimes helped to put клистир the violent patient. These procedures so impressed the meek creature that once he did not sustain and stole the device. Morson left with him on a roof of hospital where used клистир as the telescope for observations for stars. According to almost all patients, he managed to discover a set of new planets and constellations. All of them were mysterious and beautiful. However, one of Morson's planets was for some reason covered with dense wool.

Lonely Russia wishes to get acquainted
Apparently, "the Russian god" did not cope with the fundamental obligations. In spite of the fact that in a short time its large-scale cult was developed, Jehovah-Jesus appeared incapable to provide even such trifle as import substitution. Not to mention price of oil and least bombing pritselnost. Perhaps, it is worth replacing god? It is necessary to remember that in heavenly labor market hundreds temporarily jobless lounge about, but still quite respectable gods and goddesses. They offer the services both to individuals, and the whole people, guaranteeing the solution of food and commodity deficiencies and eternity of the mode which chose them. For example, the Ancient Egyptian specialist on fertility goddess Mut is absolutely free now. "To Russian miru" it has to be extremely close it image. It is insatiable the blood-thirsty mother who is giving birth to adult soldiers and with a smile devouring their corpses. This is the opponent of abortions, cosmetics, astronomy and tourism. At it fine recommendations from the last place of work: colleagues on a pantheon, and also many papyruses of pyramids characterize Mut as rested and vindictive pervert. What is especially valuable, the beauty goddess has a vagina of the improbable sizes that will allow to cover with it the remains of science and the industry of the Russian Federation. And then already nothing will interfere with establishment in the country of total spirituality. Let's note that the material aspect of a cult of this goddess is significantly more economic than Orthodoxy. There is no need for kilometers of brocade and tons of costume jewelry. Nevertheless the ceremony of a unification with Mut is much more spectacular, than religious processions and liturgies. Once in a year the Supreme hieratic priesthood and the top officials of the state have to gather on the coast of "the deep river" and make publicly over it waters act of masturbation. The Ancient Egyptian administration poured out a seed the to Nile. But will descend and any other water area, like Volga, Nevsky or the Moskva River. No withdrawal pains of hierarchy will be required. The church management should be shaved only bare and to undress a little bit. According to assurances of the Book dead, execution of this sacrament guarantees fertility of lands and growth of national currency. The question of survival of this Ancient Egyptian clamp can be it is solved in the shortest possible time. If Russia seriously treats one religious rubbish why not to treat it with the same respect also for another? Today we have an opportunity to watch ripening of abscess of national greatness. And it is already clear that Russians are full of determination to grow up it to the extraordinary sizes and for

18

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

the sake of this record are ready for everything. On refusal of freedoms, the rights, products, medicine, resorts, development, wellbeing and technologies. On an impoverishment and isolation. On a complete separation with a civilization. They very much want, having shut from the world, to suck the originality and to cherish precious abscess. Undoubtedly, it is very sublime choice. Of course, it is not too original. The nations already repeatedly grew up something similar. Unfortunately, it was experimentally proved that such abscesses contain only pain, poverty, ruin, turns and death notifications. And in so unlimited number that is enough for all. And on those who are eager for sufferings, and on those whom death notifications do not delight. Any more in these abscesses there is nothing. And pus does not differ in special nutritiousness. Naive Russia believes that in it furuncle there will be something else. That juiciness of abscess costs wellbeing of two-three of generations. That the tryaseniye kokoshniks, bellies, crosses, beards and rusty rockets will have result self-sustaining prosperity and eternal public happiness. But, as it became clear, national greatness – redkostno the senseless piece which is not making any practical application and sense. It is not capable neither to dress, nor to support, nor to cure. It is good only to squeeze out delight tears from physiognomies of the izborsky Black Hundreds celebrating a victory over dissent and condoms. And more for anything. Aspiration to it – waste of time which is taken away from the valid development. Will pass few years, abscess will burst. Ruined – and sharply grown wiser – the country again will begin to wink at neighbors in the world, to bow and meet them anew. Perhaps, neighbors will believe again and will postpone the aspen stakes prepared for Russia. What, however, is improbable. Exhausted by the abscess, the Russian Federation will be so weak and helpless that it will be difficult for neighbors to keep from temptation to razderbanit it finally. In this case "the Russian god" already definitely not will save. All hope only for the beauty Mut and efficiency of an old Egyptian ceremony over the small river.

Do not grow old soul a celery
All dead "for the homeland" gave the life for nonsenses, mistakes or whims of the mode To veterans of the Second World War, and also this text has no relation to any other realities of the USSR or the Russian Federation. All coincidence is casual. In the 1870th years daguerreotypes1 stopped being a wonder and began to extend in Europe. This circumstance allowed hostesses of brothels of Hamburg to increase profitability of the institutions repeatedly. And without any costs of updating or improvement of the state. How? Very simply. The picture of the maiden of indescribable seducement was shown to tipsy sailors. A bandit ruff swore that and the generous client will get this being. Were heated by Matrosiki, emptied pockets and got in a queue. And the hostess, having used difficult system of doors of a brothel, somewhere disappeared. After a while the hand bell sounded, the door was opened, and the sailor had an opportunity to get up on "the genius of true beauty". Certainly, everything occurred in complete darkness. As a rule, played a role of "perfection from a daguerreotype" itself a bandit ruff, in time to run, pull down musty drawers and to settle down in a convenient pose. Darkness and brevity of contact

saved it from exposure, and the sailor for the rest of the natural kept confidence that lived life not for nothing. As you probably already guessed, the sketch in a lupanariya illustrates the scheme of the relations of the person with the mode and "homeland". The illustration is correct. And at "homeland" the most part is hidden in history darkness that gives the authorities an opportunity to palm off on the client anything. The mode can be as much as silly, spiteful and pernicious. It can lap in "blood and pus of the people", to force, humiliate and kill millions of citizens. But if he is able to show the one and only focus, then the killed and forced population always to it will be grateful. From the mode it is required only to manage to pretend to be "homeland". To make it not simply, and it is very simple. The matter is that the concept "homeland" is so abstract and illusory that it is easily transformed to any political matter. The amusing construct in which illusion and reality are merged without any visible seams and transitions is formed. Where one comes to an end and another begins, it is almost impossible to distinguish. Of course, for 99,9% this construct consists of the pure mode. However it is not necessary to underestimate also a role of illusion. At it important narcotic function which allows the power to cut on live and to the dead, creating "on behalf of the fatherland" any wildnesses. Practically each mode with ease makes this substitution. Of course, this pure fraud, but the people is eager to be fooled. He wants the homeland. To refuse to it it is still big cruelty, than to suppurate in camps and to shoot. Strictly speaking, the fine concept "homeland" is pure trick. Any "homeland" at anybody never existed. There was only a sequence of the modes which disposed of the population to the own benefit. That "to live long and happily", the modes weaved mythology necessary to them and impregnated it poison of patriotic romanticism. This web also enveloped generation behind generation. Certainly, sometimes such webs are weaved masterly though samples meet more simply more often. The best raw materials for their production baizes about feats of ancestors are. It is known that such fairy tales can be generated in unlimited number. Within own language and the culture any nation is not limited in these imaginations in any way. The illusion of "homeland" made of such ingredients provides fine obedience and due vigor of fooled. Of course, from the mode some efforts are required in order that the patriotic web was strong, sticky and poisonous. But this work pays off. All dead "for the homeland" actually always gave the life for the mode. For it nonsenses, mistakes or whims.1 Let's note that "homeland" does not wage wars and does not arrange repressions. They are incorporeal and exist only in imagination. Wars and repressions are always an entertainment of the modes. In all this there is nothing terrible. It is the ordinary, arranging all order of things. The dead are, as a rule, happy, and mutilated at least are satisfied. Besides, that the trick of substitution works smoothly, war in itself - it is a rare and pleasant opportunity for the population to adjoin to greatness of historical processes, a feat, sanctity, sacrifice and other rubbish. Long time the modes concentrated memory about the military greatness in ceremonial portraits and monuments of masters. The melkota which survived in battles was stopped decaying in poverty and oblivion. Then understanding came that the cult of the old tell-tales who are given short weight by trinkets who gave for the mode of an eye or leg can work for him more productively, than any portraits and triumphal arches.

Played a role and the brilliant invention in the form of military awards. It is known that this ancient cunning allows any power to make very favorable exchange. Person gives to the mode hearing, sight, years or extremities, and in exchange receives a brilliant blyambochka. As a rule, the victim of such fraud very much rejoices to the fact that it naduril, is also proud of a symbol of the nonsense. In lupanariya of Rome to pobrenchat decrepit fans medals calledand "apiya", that is seldereyam.1 Perhaps, this nickname arose because of tradition to decorate with tomb opium branches, but it is rather because of similarity of veteran physiognomies to a celery root. Over time the seldereysky component became an important detail of illusion of "homeland". Enthusiastic honoring апиев began, regardless of for what they were spoiled and received the blyambochka. But! We know that there are modes, even to die for which – a crime. Those that turn the countries into prisons and everything impregnate with slavery, denunciations and death. Those that kill and are suppurated by millions of citizens, and remaining and недопосаженNых – humiliate and force. But if there is an external threat, then and here goes in the course an old trick by the name of "homeland". And it works again. Millions are under construction and with songs go to die for an opportunity and to live further in death. And having protected the mode and having returned, winners obediently get back into the shackles and cages. And then still long remember how saved "fatherland" though actually they asserted only the right to beg, scribble at each other denunciations and to die in firing ditches. This exotic choice could seem a riddle if we did not know about omnipotence of one old trick. Remains one question: how long, and, above all, why it is necessary to hold in remembrance this choice?

Naked patriarch, or Mickey Mouse's Law
The recent embarrassment which happened to the owner of "A silver galosh" proved the old truth: the patriarch can be any, but only not naked. He can be the gloomy profligate as Feofil, or, on the contrary cheerful the eunuch, as Stephen I who became to "holy" in 18 years. It can be warty as the secret heretic Kirill Lukary, or to become famous for the improbable force and loudness of emission of gases as Ioann Grammatik – "candles extinguishing and choruses muffling". Constantinople, Jerusalem, Antioch and other patriarchal thrones store prints of the most pious buttocks of the world. Quite often their owners were deaf, lame, bald and slanting. Sometimes they were epileptic, and sometimes had diarrhea, gout or an incontience. But, as it became clear for two thousand years, any specifics of appearance, behavior or health had no and has no value for fulfillment of duties of "holy". However, one most strict taboo always existed: never and under no circumstances the patriarch could be naked. Especially he could not defile in such look in search of small resort pleasures. Also put not in senile "an obvisaniya body" at all, and not in a poteshnost family "trusely", and that the patriarch, as well as any other actor historical theater, exactly for 100% "is made" of the suit, a make-up and a role. "Because brocade is his skin, and параман – his body". It is not necessary to expose the patriarch because even in Russian the word "expose" has distinct double sense, including extremely unpleasant for exposed. Deprived dress and accessories, the changed clothes for simple "body", any patriarch loses the role magic, "desakralizutsya" and turns into the ordinary old man whose place in line for beer.

But business at all not in distressful Kiryushe who managed to walk smack in the next scandal. In this case it serves only as the visual aid by means of which we can illustrate a thought of fragility of any "high" image and through it to approach artificiality of such concepts as "personality", "charisma" and "passionarity". As we see, nakedness is almost deadly. In a varying degree, it concerns any character of both church, and secular history. The concept "nakedness", of course, it is not necessary to treat only literally this word. The gilded peel of any sacral "fruit" is not only a hood, a panagia, armor, a uniform or feathers. It both frills of heroic imaginations, and the necessary facts "tense" on the character which are easily stamped by chroniclers and are corrected by historians. Having cleaned off this peel, we almost with guarantee will receive something very pathetic. It is necessary to remember that any "the historical figure" corresponds to the real person of whom it "is made", approximately the same as Mickey Mouse with an ordinary mouse. Let's explain. There is a multi-billion brand: brilliant Mickey, hero of the world cult. This mouse occupies pedestals in the Disneylands and serves as subject to a peculiar worship there. Millions of people are decorated to an izobrazhaMickey's niya or his symbolics,1 participate in devoted to it processions, fireworks, holidays and in general in all ways "be touched his name". And there is a real prototype of lovely Mickey – Mus musculus: a rodent with a specific smell of urine and ability to perepakostit all it adjoins to. Having participated in Disney's cult of a mouse and having removed "ears", admirers clever Mickey is habitually poisoned house "mice" with phosphide of zinc or break them ridges in mousetraps. They can be understood. Prototypes of heroes, as a rule, deserve phosphide. And it concerns not only mice. If we open gilded hulks of history or culture, then by all means we will find out that they teem prototypes and their derivatives.2 As a rule, their communication is among themselves completely caused by "Mickey Mouse's law". The law works both in one, and in other party: real characters are given short weight by beautiful mythemes, and to mythical heroes properties of real people "are attached". Even the magic wooden boy Pinocchio – and how it becomes clear, was "copied" from the elderly alcoholic disabled person Pinocchio Sanchez who at fairs of Tuscany traded in demonstration of the artificial limbs. At Sanchez legs, the left hand and a part of a nose were wooden. Its performances did not differ director's delicacy: Sanchez beat with a sustavchaty artificial limb of a leg under the back of the assistant. That with cries fell, and eternally drunk Pinocchio threw up "under peak" a wooden hand and coquettishly exchanged bows. By the way. "Mickey Mouse's law" puts an end in a discussion about I. Christ's historicity. Having applied it to so ticklish subject, we will not leave in it any intrigue. It is quite possible that some excited rabbi with heavy destiny and with it "First name, middle initial, last name" really lived and died in Judea the 1st century, and designers of Christianity just used it as "hanger" on which they fastened paranormal abilities and other "soupAva set" antique deity.3 Also we will remember Mowgli. In a kiplingovsky legend it is osiyanny gloss of Old Indian gold the talkative handsome, and also the friend of cobras, elephants and peasants. But! We know from whom Kipling wrote off the Mowgli. Also we can estimate contrast between the well-known image and reality.

In missionary shelters of Sultanopur and Agra the writer had an opportunity to touch the end of the cane of original "wild" children. Krovotochivy calloused outgrowths on elbows and knees of the size of "cake on two persons" as they moved roofing felt were distinctive feature of "forest" kidsto on all fours. Presents "Maugl" differed in total absence of the speech and any gleams of intelligence. Doctor D. Uishau surveying them demonstrates that "wild Hindu boys were the valid idiots what was the reason of their idiocy". They soiled with all the excrements, till it bleeds bit a service staff for legs and constantly masturbated. However, in the conditions of a shelter they, as a rule, died quicker, than at kind Hindus the final decision on their udavleniye ripened. Sometimes existence of a prototype is obvious, but it remains it is hidden from descendants and researchers. To romantics it allows to hope that, for example, "Little Prince" was a fruit only of pedofilsky hallucinations of French pilot, but not there was in carne.1 Cult of gods, prophets, heroes, commanders and other "super activists" – one of the most favourite cults of homo. The mankind is thrilled with feathers, uniforms and "charisma", and names of the favourites marks eras. Religions, history and culture are based on this cult. Unfortunately, for its destruction it is not enough of one, even chemically true cynicism of the highest concentration. Something more essential is required. Illusion of the fact that in human packs there are individuals allocated the extreme properties which are qualitatively distinguishing them from other people is very resistant. There is even a branch of history, seriously studying "super activists". People very much like to attribute global events to features of this or that "personality". This amusing delusion has many roots. One of them – lack of understanding that practically all "charisma" for 100% are made of casual circumstances, and also of requirements of political fashion and specifics of the time. In slightly other reality they would remain nobody, and their "surprising" properties would not exert any impact neither on history, nor on culture.2 Estimating "great names", it is worth to remember that for each Mickey Mouse the ordinary mouse hides. Especially well it is visible on still «warm" Napoleon, Hitler, Stalin, Mao's examples or to them similar figures. All blood and nonsense is written off for them though these persons involved were only "cherries on cakes" of the eras and the people. All Germany was Hitler, and the USSR – Stalin. In the happened tragedies personal qualities of leaders had no special value. Of course, all of them could influence partly processes, but not owing to existence some "charisma" and only because had purely mechanical opportunity it to do. But we will remind that they did not invent it independently, and only used that mechanism of the power which was formed at the time of Pharaohs and did not undergo essential changes. But! Sauron-gipnotizatora who could inspire in a magic way in the kind and naive people of the idea of a Reich or "Russian mira" is not among them. Dictators and presidents are only tamburmazhor which by means of "a staff of the power" set a rhythm to the convulsions of rage and delight arising in masses naturally. If the staff falls or will be rejected, "little band" will not cease to play. Most likely, any role of the personality in the history – the next self-deception, and a certain intellectual or behavioural uniqueness – the myth which in reality is not existing and on anything not influencing. However, until we we remain in the so-called cultural and historical field where all otsenochno and unsteadily, these statements remain only the declaration. To prove them, to us it is necessary to move to qualitatively other spheres.

Fortunately, besides martinets, prophets and leaders, an image of each of which evidently it is subordinated "to the law M. - the Mouse", we have also figures of other property. Those who actually changed reality of the world or increased chances of our view of survival. We mean creators of science. Here on their example we will also try to prove unprovable: cantankerousness and vydumannost of ideas of uniqueness of the personality. Let's remind that interrelation of the personality scientist and its opening is несоmnenny and standard dogma.1 Perhaps, an essential contribution to science – it is valid result of absolutely special, unique characteristics inherent only in concrete to the scientist and to anybody to other? Full confidence is that the situation is quite so, it was unambiguously stated by a great number of creators of modern knowledge. In the best way this thought was formulated by the neurophysiologist, the Nobel Prize laureate John Carew Ekklz seeing the best proofs of free will of the person and "a great factor of the personality" in the fact of discoveries. James Dewey Watson, too the Nobel Prize laureate, sootkryvatel of structure of DNA and the author "Molecular gene biology" which by right it is possible to call one of the most important books человечесtva, believed that "each step2 forward, and sometimes and back – the event deeply personal in which the major role is played by human characters and national traditions is very frequent". Still other Nobel laureate – Christian de Duv who writes that "creation of the theory is is more categorical intense the creative process which is bearing the impress of the identity of the author", and the Einstein theory of relativity, according to De Duva, bears on "print of the individual, personal traits peculiar only it to the creator". At first sight this point of view seems only logical and possible. But only at first sight. And at contact with the facts from this beautiful assumption not remains even loci udi.3 The matter is that very many major inventions, and also detection of laws of the nature and properties of matter were almost synchronously made scientists, not connected among themselves in any way, completely independent from each other, carried national, geographically, socially it is also religious. Possibly, here nevertheless it is necessary to stop and concretize the concept "independence of opening in science". What is it? It is the term which we mark a certain high scientific result if to it came scientists, not having opportunities to borrow thoughts and the ideas each other. Let's bring short selection of the facts, that is it is enumerable those discoveries which were made "independently" and "at the same time": Cavendish and the Pendent opened the law of an attraction and pushing away of electric charges; By Paracelsus and U. von Gutten it is declared influence of syphilis on a head and spinal cord; Zh. Zhansen and Lokayer made the spectral analysis of prominences of a solar disk; Ramzayem and Langle are revealed properties of helium; Darwin and Wallace formulated the theory of evolution; Adams and Leverye found the planet the Neptune; Marconi and Popov invented radio; Oparin and Haldane opened the principles of an abiogenesis; Marriott and Boyle calculated features of behavior of gases; Augustus Tepler and Wilhelm Golz invented the influence machine; Skaliger and Aretsio realized existence of a kinesthesia; Gay-Lussac, Jacques Charles and Dalton output the law volumes; von Gerike and Torricelli are defined properties of vacuum; Zh. Fernel and P. Forrest defined the poisoning influence of mercury on a brain; Galilei, de Chezo and Olbers solved a paradox of blackness of the Universe; Borelli and Zhyuren found the capillary

phenomena; The Hertz and Lodge recorded electromagnetic waves; Thomson, Dzhermer and Devisson deciphered diffraction of electrons; Newton and Guk it is defined law of the return proportionality to a square of distances; Huygens and Galilei created the pendulum clock; Kotunyo and Morangdi is found out a role of a likvor and laws of its circulation between brain ventricles; Descartes and Snellius opened effect of light refraction; Bennet and Eandi simulated the electroscope; Sheele, Priestley and Lavoisier is classified hydrogen; Malpigy and G. Badzhlivi fixed the mechanism of developing of a hemiplegia; By Maier and Joule the principle of equivalence is understood; Galilei and Sheyner found spots in the Sun; Latur and Faraday established liquefaction of gases; Dalton and Volta described behavior of vapors; Mendeleyev and Meir opened the periodic law; Veynberg and Hardy proved the law of genetic balance; Russell and Gertsshprung made charts qualifiers stars; By Murray Gell-Mang and J. Zweig it is written quantaая model of elementary particles1; Möbius and Lister removed a paradox of "Moebius band"; Lobachevsky and Boyai developed hyperbolic geometry. The list can be continued, but we believe that given there is enough. So, we were convinced that scientists, having between themselves nothing in common on education, by training, on beliefs, in any way not acquaintances among themselves, approximately at the same time came to the same conclusions on the most important questions of the universe. Even in our short list dandies and slovens, ardent fascists and sad Russian engineers mixed up, distinguished academicians and brewers, merry fellows and melancholiacs, fanatical Christians and atheists, convinced bachelors and approximate heads of families, plebeians and aristocrats, and also burgomasters, communists, royalists, peers, revolutionaries, priors of monasteries and duelists. Listed above by us – only a visible, official part of images great scientists. In most cases sensitivity did not allow biographers to go deep into some features of their life, habits and bents. But we know that any homo has very picturesque back. Suspecting about it, we can assume reasonably that distinctions between svershitel of the same opening were still more strikingly: between von Gerike and Torricelli, Marriott and Boyle, Marconi and Popov there were not just "differences", and whole "abysses". And nevertheless they, independently from each other, at the same time came to the same fatal conclusions. All personal, national, religious, household, political differences did not play any role. But perhaps, this not coherence of opening and the personality is inherent only relatively in local enlightenments? Perhaps, the most grandiose theories nevertheless are based on certain unique lines of their creator? No. As we can be convinced, the regularity noticed by us extends to any opening, irrespective of their scale. For example: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace never met and did not communicate. Till 1858 Darwin did not know about Alfred Russell's existence. But in June of the year stated above Wallace sent to Darwin a sketch of the article "To a Tendency of Independent Emergence of Variations from an Original Form". Having unpacked a package, shaken Darwin saw in Wallace's lines the own theory which nuances he hid till time even from so close friends as Hooker and Layel.

"I never saw more amazing coincidence. If at Wallace my draft copy written in 1842, it could not сочto init for it the best summary".1 Certainly, there are theories not less global, than evolutionary. Abiogeneticheskaya was independently developed by Alexander Ivanovich Oparin and John Haldane who were very much reliably are isolated from each other by geography, a difference scientific школ and the most banal policy.2 First both tragically apprehended news of presence of "competitor" on other continent, but situation3 the chivalrous Haldane who recognized Oparin's developments more saved capacious and large-scale, and respectively, and more significant. Theories also have an ambiguous origin: quantum, genetic code, relativity and conditioned reflexes. At everything4 awe of names of Einstein, Pavlov, Shout, Planck of anybody fromx it is impossible to call them "author".5 We can carefully draw a conclusion that to us is not present and there can be no business to household habits or private judgments of this or that creator of science. All composed persons have no value. As, however, and the personality. Scientist can be the Satanist, the greedy person, the onanist, the spendthrift, the usurer, the pickpocket, the religious fanatic, the pedophile, the murderer, the slanderer, the envious person, the hero, the thief, the homosexual, the virgin, the normal libertine, the hypocrite or the scoffer, the gloomy taciturn person or the brilliant speaker. For result of its work all this matters no more, than a form of a cover of its coffin. Or color of his eyes. He can be a self-educated person as Reaumur, Fahrenheit, Ampere, Laplace, Dalton, Kepler, and can be an abbot as Mendel, or the journalist as Engels, the academician as Oparin, or mercenary, as Descartes, bookbinder, as Faraday, the school teacher, as Tsiolkovsky, the salesman in grocery store, as Shliman, or the professional inhabitant of laboratories, as K. S. Leshli. But also all this too means nothing. These characters became history of science"naked", at an entrance having dumped cassocks, armor, frock coats and laboratory dressing gowns. However, as it becomes clear, business was not limited to clothes objects. Strictly speaking, in the same place, at an entrance, they left also the names. The matter is that in the opening we never let's find signs of the personality of the one who made it. It is "surprisingly faceless" and is not connected with character, habits and views of his author in any way. Let's "untie" comprehension of DNA from names Shout, Watson, Wilkins, Franklin, Everi, Chargaff and for several minutes we will forget these names. Let's forget also the tragicomedy accompanying understanding of a role and "a spatial configuration" of deoxyribonucleic acid. Having made all this, let's find whether we in spirals of the nitrogenous bases or as hydrogen communications at least echoes of that juicy fact that J. Watson did not know chemistry at all, and T. Shout had no scientific degree? No. Not let's find. Whether we in the solved sequence of adenine – a timina – a guanine – a tsitozin will see a sad shadow of O. T. Everi or a tear dying Franklin? Besides not. Let's not see. And now we will glance in a microscope eyepiece. Whether there is a reminder on the Dutch clothier there, playing glass balls?6 At first he just was amused. But then, combining balls, their

halves, the clothier made out through them the movements of spermatozoa in "viscous liquid, collected after a lawful coition with Mrs. Levenguk". Whether some instruction on a style of a hat of this clothier contains in a microscope eyepiece though, or on to what deity it bowed on Sundays? Certainly, no. Does not contain. As we see, all personal dematerializovatsya again and disappeared as not having any value. Moreover, at us appeared still one basis for confidence that between identity scientist and its opening there is no communication at all. So, we we see with what ease it is possible to destroy one of the main myths of culture. The myth about the personality and it "extreme value". But what we receive instead of it? Almost nothing, except for an image of science as the reality living under the laws. The greatest names in it are almost blind performers of the law of inevitable development of intelligence. That intelligence, which always will find correct town to both rascal Kiryushe, and Bonaparte, and Mickey Mouse.

End of ROC. As it will be
"The father of church" Origen Aleksandriysky was the real Christian. Therefore it literally executed an order of the god, stated in the Gospel,1 – and a broad gesture snipped off to itself genital body up to the testicles, having become skoptsy "for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven". Unfortunately, not all Christians followed its pious example though exchange of a penis for "Kingdom of Heaven" from their point of view has to be extremely favorable business. It is possible to tell, the transaction of life. In the Russian church this evangelical offer was, as a rule, ignored too. Metropolitans, archbishops and bishops, not to mention monashestvuyushchy brotherhood and laymen, choosing between "Kingdom of Heaven" and own penis, surely chose a penis. It is twice sad as Origen's experience could protect ROC from a set of troubles in the past and the present, and also teach it firmness which, perhaps, will be required to it soon. Very long there was an illusion that the ROC is able to be accustomed to drinking tightly with any kind of the state ideology, and can die only together with it. To it Orthodox Christians were taught by specially invented story of Russia. Something similar was inspired in them by the ideologist of the Russian Nazism – Fyodor Dostoyevsky. It always gave to bottoms unusual confidence in destiny of own business and the corporate wellbeing. Of course, church trade in nothing is a business superprofitable. But also extremely fragile as completely depends on whims and mood of the power. And also from as far as the power is sure of efficiency of church. Convulsively saving the country from disintegration, today's Kremlin, certainly, puts everything that is near at hand on use. Everything that can "fasten" the country, especially without understanding quality of these clamps. Including church. But it is not excluded that absolute inefficiency of ROC will be noticed sooner or later by him. That will occur in this case? By ROC, of course, it was forgotten and underestimated danger of such exposure. As we remember, the church always claimed: it – a concept eternal and any "a gate of an adova will not overcome it". But today's Orthodoxy probably poorly imagines the original potential of this "gate".

If exposure takes place and it will become once again clear that the church of nobody to anybody fastens, then probably will occur following. This time there will be no "lions roaring of flesh Christians, eager", and any sailors with shtychka. Nobody and a finger will touch priests. Everything will be much worse. Become unnecessary the Kremlin, the ROC will instantly lose inviolability in all media. Will begin to creak, that "gate" will be opened – and will burst from them a blue thunder. All TV main channels will be filled by tear-stained sextons, ipodyakona, novices, seminarists and young monks. And each of them will picture misadventures of the anus which was daily tormented "metropolitans, archbishops and bishops". Also we torment not always with a prayer. Showmen, still yesterday, the handles which were faithfully giving smacking kiss to bottoms, will angrily shake documents of criminal cases, finding out at crybabies juicy details anal the practician, and learning – to sob together with them, "having distorted horror the faces". Certainly, not all scandals will be painted in purely blue color. Will be on air the town and for couple of hundreds of black pedofilsky stories. Here still "gate" will more widely be opened – and not only the victims and showmen vosplanut. All will sob here: mummies who entrusted to bottoms of children, kids remote grandmothers on Skype, operators and studio claquers. Even severe criminalists, invited in air for the story about specifics of vaginal and sfinkterny gaps at minors, too "izlit tears the". It is necessary to understand that the rydatelny potential of this subject, of course, not бездонен, but is rather deep. Media will fulfill it at full scale probably more than once having remembered about Origen Aleksandriysky. Of course, public it is necessary not only to cry, but also to have a laugh. Ensuring fun on a church subject will not be a problem too. In this sense passions in convents will become excellent information goods. The inhabitant learns at last that it "deep sisterly" the kiss, will comprehend the true meaning of cultivation by nuns of vegetable marrows of a grade zucchini and will understand original mission of very young novices. It is easy to predict also all subsequent changes of media dishes. Mournful GAI officers will cover air with blood, having told thousands of stories of a popovsky lawlessness on roads. Teachers it is at the top of the voice tightened a song about the absurdity of "fundamentals of Orthodoxy" at schools. The begun to see clearly heads of administrations will develop battle cloths, narrating about the fights with greedy bottoms for the social real estate and goszeml. Will wake up aunties from SES. They will crack about virus puzyrchatka of an oral cavity, the candidiases, purulent phlegmons and other diseases which are inevitably transferred in that case when hundreds of not really healthy people eat something with one spoon from one bowl as it happens at a participle ceremony. The media market is insatiable to any juicy horror: "gate" will be opened wide open – and the ROC will be remembered by all. What was also what was not. The badgered priests will look for belltowers to be dumped from them, but will not find them; they will grab bowls with poison, but in those there will be only an old kefir. And the show business which yearned for years of the Russian spring on a svezhatinka will continue to crucify poor fellows. Will try especially those who are stronger than others toadied on religious processions and prayful standings: deputies, canaries-derzhavnitsy, motorcyclists and other messengers of orthodox spirituality.

Certainly, hunters поковырятьс will right there be foundI in the mysterious death of Rediger1 and in church finance. Alas, the one and only audit of monetary tricks of clergy will turn the episcopate of ROC into crowd of sad convicts. Priests will be driven from schools and by armies, and planetaria which are wrung out by them and hospitals will return to the state. Installation in churches of cash registers will be the last and most crushing blow of "gate". After that the market of magic services will fail. To such option of "persecutions" of ROC it will be absolutely not ready. Under a public laughter Gundyaev will run away, having dressed up as the crucified boy from Donbass. Chaplin will buy a kettle, at last will grow normal short moustaches and will continue to serve the surname in the Moscow music hall. And the church will shrink and for a long time will break off. At it, of course, there will be a choice: or to disappear finally, having dissolved in one hundred other cults, or to survive and continue fight for return of clients. It will not be simple to survive it. Vatican which appeared in similar, but less difficult situation went for broke. It sharply brushed away from a table otpedofilirovanny to them babies "a yak not being" and made sharp image reform. Instead of the father idol he offered the father punks. It was the strong course, but the shiner and a tram ticket of Francis completely did not succeeded to cover "big Vatican shame" after all yet. The slingshot which is incidentally found by CIA in personal belongings of the pontiff will probably be the following step. At least, Jesuits lay all hopes for rescue of Catholicism on it. And here the ROC to get off so light it will not turn out. It is necessary to change not only girls, but also furniture. Become unnecessary the Kremlin, ROC it will be forced to obey to furious laws of show business. In ceremonies and liturgical practice it is necessary to make cardinal changes. It will be very good to look departure of the new patriarch from an imperial gate on the monowheel electroscooter, and also vigorous "dances with bowls". As the strong media resonance had only one precedent of dancings in church, to teach choreography in seminaries will probably be invited by Pussy Riot. Perhaps, ROC will invent still some baits. Perhaps, it will return to itself a part of the old clients will also be, not offended by nobody any more, under chirr cash registers to exist on dark corners of the country. Certainly, under strong supervision of tax authorities and SES, gradually collapsing under weight of own uselessness. But to any vital issues and events of ROC it will never be allowed any more. So if Russia is also fated further history, then it will obviously come true without priests.

Wing or leg?
Long-awaited point in the history of imperial remains Identification of a skeleton of Nicholas II is carried out with such eagerness, as if his bones collect not for symbolical burial, and for production of a unique jelly. Twenty years very expensive commissions fence someone's tibial bones and drill ears of officials genetic terminology. Twenty years criminalists smear each other faces with dirt from "ganinoyama" and "ponasenkovalog", and patriots rehearse sobbings over a coffin of the last tsar. The press and public pine waiting for day X when under thousand-public singing Nikolay Krovavy's remains are solemnly placed in a sarcophagus of the Peter and Paul Fortress. Though, as well as any other, this burial makes very conditional sense. No authenticity of a skeleton is also required. The main thing that "the suit sat"; the tombstone has to be equipped by

record quantity of two-headed eagles and extraordinary dynastic terminology. It will be perfect enough. In fact, there is no difference what bones under it will be put. It can be remains of any janitor or twenty five guinea pigs. Moreover, in a sarcophagus it is possible to put nothing at all. And it is possible to place mops or Kobzon's international passport there. What there lay, Cossacks honourable guard all the same will be deeply moved waiting for funeral vodka. And for the people it is absolutely indifferent that will be in a grave. Inflows of its feelings are regulated not by identity of DNA, but power of cordons and presence at a ceremony of "top officials". Let's remind that quite recently the experiment with known "belt" was put. On authenticity degree this subject can be compared only to the "real" propeller of Carlson which was exhibited at the World of Little Morons exhibition recently. But! The experiment was successful. "memory of material" worked: Russia used the first pretext to take the form of huge tear-stained turn habitual to it. In a sense the action was even more successful, than experiences with other shrines: with the Mausoleum and McDonald's. Perhaps, it occurred because organizers of "belt" managed to realize the huge potseluyechny potential of the people. Of course, it is necessary to involve in filling of an imperial sarcophagus more actively ROC with it extensive experience of an outfoxing of citizens. Let's remember the twentieth years. Bolsheviks then made indicative openings top church мощехранилищ. Besides rotten bones, dolls and larvae of a moth they found even ladies' podmyshechnik, teapots, boards and to bank of a fiksatuar Brokar there. Everything was made publicly, fixed on cinema – and film, but was not reflected in the subsequent pochitayemost of artifacts in any way. As soon as villains in side curls and leather jackets laid "relics" back, воцерковлёthe nny public continued prayful communication with teapots and fiksatuary. In the history with imperial remains it is possible to adopt this precious experience. Total revival of dead persons which is promised by Christian dogmatics probably will be followed by various cataclysms and the announcement of state of emergency. In such situation there is no special difference who exactly will get out from under a gravestone in the Peter and Paul Fortress: pigs, janitor or Nicholas II's half. Of course, preparing put X, follows still to work over image of the last tsar which pulls only so far on near the man with a cigarette and a balerinka. Possibly, except his ability to direct mass executions of the population on Nevsky Avenue, it is worth remembering also his passion to a vykladyvaniye of geometrical patterns from the cats who are personally killed with it and crows. It is probably not necessary to do only one. It is not necessary on a sarcophagus cover at all in the Peter and Paul Fortress to mention the incredible rating of this man.

Victory fly agarics
Will go whether to mankind on advantage global atomic warfare? By Ruzhyishko, of course, it was depended. Since it was placed on "carnation" of Hiroshima, nuclear weapon decorates a scene of human history, reminding that all most interesting still ahead. It agrees to laws of dramatic art, it ружьишко, of course, will shoot. Whether it will be able it is cardinal to change the existing reality and a design of a civilization? The event, most likely, is inevitable.

30

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

Why? Because in 70 years which passed since that moment when the first nuclear fly agaric grew over the Japanese remote place there was no partial poumneniye of homo even. On the contrary рazlichny savage toys like traditions, religions, victories and patriotism became still more popularly. All fundamental illusions feel perfectly too and continue to define outlook of absolute majority. Person remains in the power of tales of the uniqueness, immortal soul, divine love and importance of national interests. Let's remind that all these beautiful chimeras are eternally hungry, and they are saturated only with blood. Many centuries of a chimera defiantly champed generations and the whole people, but the mankind continues by them be touched. Alas, it does not sober, despite all the bitter experience. It firmly it is sure that at a civilization – the excellent ethical base. In general, as it became clear, illusions – piece fire-resistant. Belief fires, the fires of revolutions and a flame of wars do not do them any harm. Possibly, time to test them something more hotly came. Necessary temperatures just can be also provided by both usual uranium bombs, and various "sloyechka" of the FFF or W88 type. However, illusory accumulation are so extensive that uranium degrees will fry only a small part of delusions of the person about themselves. What will remain will be quite enough as required to repeat nuclear fireworks. The root reasons of an event nobody will look for, certainly. The culture and history will add oils, and the event will receive assessment according to the available "ethical representations". It will automatically bring a situation to the second, and then and to the third circle. So to hope that in tritium - uranium fire the mankind will be melted into something more decently, probably, nevertheless does not follow. Of course, there is a consolatory baize that certain "limiting factor" mutual lethality of nuclear bombing will work. I believe that this statement is wrong. The matter is that any atomic blows do not constitute any danger to those who make the decision on their drawing. At the disposal of solvers there are comfortable bunkers from which it is possible to watch mutual nuclear excesses safely. Certainly, to observe with tears in the eyes, whispering1 songs about palm trees or birches. From depth of these bunkers2 it will be possible to knock in a Stalin way with teeth about a glass and once again to remind that "we behind the price will not stand". And the frightened "price", being incinerated together with the cats, houses and kids, again will be forced to agree with such generosity. And how differently? "Price" is accustomed to serve as an expendable material for ensuring needs of various homeland, religions, borders, and also the general esthetics of history in general. With "price" Lish is enoughь to talk3 for and on behalf of great illusions that she was deeply moved and held up foreheads under streams of neutrons. Though it would be incorrect to blame for everything only solvers of destinies; we deal with the fact of mutual training. People accustomed to spend the power them for "the great purposes" recklessly and involuntarily. This situation can be illustrated a set of examples, but the so-called "Immortal regiment" which procession sometimes can be observed in Russia will be the freshest. The essence of an action is that the citizens of the Russian Federation going big organized columns bear portraits of the relatives who died in the war on sticks. It symbolizes unity of the people in griefs and a silent, but terrible call to that enemy because of whom died represented on portraits people. But!

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

The probability that approximately on a third of portraits those who were destroyed only because of the most Soviet command are depicted is extremely high: the killed zagradbatalyonam thrown into the senseless attacks starved by front or rear hunger, frozen, "welded" in coppers, and also shot drunk by Smershevtsami. Soldier's meat in Russia was always exclusive cheap also it was, as a rule, spent by generals with enchanting wastefulness. But to none of participants of a procession not will come in the head to accuse of the death of the father or great-grandfather of those butchers generals of the USSR who were the valid responsible for death of their relatives. Thereby the procession of "An immortal regiment" turns into the indulgence of the power, in the offer to it and from now on to spend lives without any constraint. It is known that a basis of the Russian spirituality and identity is the Jewish folklore, incarnate in so-called Orthodoxy. In this case he does not learn to stuff a pike, but imparts a resistant habit to go to bat and crucify. Alas, by the XXI century the orthodox idea so exhausted that will hardly be able to serve as a good anesthesia that day when over the Russian Federation and the world nuclear fly agarics of a victory rise. All hope only for models and tenors who continue to claim that "beauty will save world". Possibly, an opportunity to strike with it fission products of the 235th uranium or a deuteride of lithium will soon be presented to them. However, fair fears are possible that dialogue of tenors with neutrons can be fascinating, but short.

Teaser for a goose. End of a discussion about Galilei
If with me speak on behalf of the truth, I at once I understand that I deal with the idiot Specialists in "sitting on a chair" something got naughty and undertook to teach me. It seems, they seriously imagined that the past is their property where without convoy of historians nobody even should look. I believe that it is worth using this situation and to clear the relations of boundaries our two crafts.1 Certainly, I am able to do it only from a journalism position. What the position is? I explain. The journalism is machine-gun nest on a belltower. It gives opportunity from reasonable height to shoot anyone, and also to organize any fireworks, at the same time for that, without answering. As the manual I intend to use this review of my article about one episode of war of original knowledge with "the scientific world". Thanks to emergence of this work we have sound and very fresh "medicine" of standard vision of the tragedy of Galilei. Let's take ukazochka and let's walk on this "medicine". Let's begin from the fact that our reviewer, undoubtedly, has a personal motivation. It is not absolutely clear. Remains to hope that it is simple itch to be noticed. It is worse if "magic communication with the past" and knowledge of "a true picture" of events moves it. In this case it is time for it to think of participation in "Psychic Challenge". For a start we will stop on the assumption, more flatter for our reviewer: it is only an itch. If this is so, then this motivation has to exert specific impact on a set of arguments and conclusions. Our "medicine" will give us now opportunity is to find out.

And at the same time to give to historians a politeness lesson.

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

We will see how "historical knowledge" is easy in skillful hands bends also it is prepared, adapting to service of any purpose and the idea. As this knowledge has no real factual frame, it is extremely plastic. It has no constants and even doctrines. With it it is possible to get up anything. I do it quite frankly, and in advance I warn that I" will "round" at discretion the invoice. But, it appears, the same is done on the quiet also by our historian reviewer. And it is already a disorder. I will remind that the journalism itself does not rummage in archives and chests. It only uses what is prepared for it coryphaeuses of various disciplines. it task – to draw global conclusions, to generalize and formulate. And what of a set of the doctrines offered it she will choose - it is it personal record. History serves journalism. But in any way not on the contrary. Business of the historian – to extract material for the publicist and it is beautiful to spread out "goods", trying not to soil at the same time to the neighbor who on the next tray offers the. Business of the publicist – to walk on these malls, to choose attracted and to use it for paradigms and conclusions. But our reviewer tries to violate rules of this eternal game. Sounding the mysterious itch, he pretends that no other ideas of Galilei's process, except its own, exist at all. It especially is amusing that the versions belonging to researchers considerably better known and successful, than he are ignored. So, attention.1 Santilyana, Ronan, Hammel, Speransky, Einstein, Coen, Menken, Lyozzi of et cetera have no almost any doubts that Galilei's process was a shop squabble of astronomers and mathematicians. Santilyana unambiguously testifies to the "scientific" nature of process. Colin Ronan writes that "incident with Galilei reminds an episode from Soviet times, when Lysenko who was in a favor pursued geneticists". Charles Hammel it is convinced, that "Galilei's condemnation was served only by intrigues scientists". Speransky gives this process as an example of opposition of aristotelianets from a matemataKami. Let's note that at Einstein2 too there were no doubts in scientific to the background process. Let's move an ukazochka slightly below in the text, there, where the reviewer insists on banal interpretation of process as oppositions of knowledge and belief. Whether the church sought to condemn Galileo? Let's note that even Dominicans, always жаwaiting for somebody to burn, and that3 support Galilei's justification. The father in the letter Tuscan writes the duke about Galilei: "We see in it not only great talents to science, but also and love to piety. It more, than someone, it is gifted all qualities granting to it the right for papal goodwill". For some reason the reviewer forgot" also what after process the father continued to pay to caught in malicious heresy to Galilei … pension.4 It is improbable that this well-known detail is unknown to the reviewer. Perhaps, it is deliberately withdrawn by it from a set of arguments as destroys the myth that Urban was strongly inflated on Galileo. As we see, ours zoit skillfully suppresses details, inconvenient for himself. It is fine as confirms our version about motivation with "itch", but not "magic vision of the past". Most likely, our reviewer is healthy and is just played by meek "facts". But! The historian should be played more accurately. The passage about a penance left very clumsily. According to the reviewer, the father "punished" Galilei reading psalms.5

However even the most mean medievalist should know that reading psalms cannot be considered as the real penance as enters the everyday prayer rule of each Catholic. Additional psalms could be appointed by the confessor who learned on a confession that his child, for example, excessively was fond of examining of pissing laundresses. "Having prescribed" the heretic Galilei psalms, Urban probably just "winked" at him, once again having reminded the offended old man about exclusive softness of a sentence and old friendship. «Learning" or not learning the father Urban – too very diskutivny question. Our lovely critic makes bold to certify Urban's knowledge of astronomy and mathematics and comes to conclusions, unfavourable for poorlyguo Barbierini. But!1 Possibly, he should remember that Pogrebyssky, Maystrov, Figuiyer characterize the father as"scientist"; Hammel presents to Matteo Barberini precisely"scientist mathematics", and R. Coen – as astronomer. Was whether Galileo physician?2 Certainly, on the only thing to the education which had at it he is a physician. The truth and it was not complete that allowed contemporaries to call Galilei "doctor half-educated person" or just "half-educated person", and to biographers Yimto novat it "great the half-educated person".3 I have no slightest desire to further give a flick to the poor reviewer. I believe, given there is enough to be convinced or of intended jugglings and distortions, or in some incompleteness of its knowledge. However, I hope for what for the work it is generous it is rewarded reader's agiotage and triumph of the local public. Of course, "fools and geese are created especially for that they were teased". But we will not disturb more our associate professor. It is necessary to leave it in the power of his itch. And it is possible, in its world of "violet mushrooms" and confidence in magic communication of the historian with the past. That only he knows "an original picture" of the past. We will be frank: such condition of the historian disturbs nobody. If it is capable to extract "ore" in the archival mine and to give accurately it upward, in science and journalism, the poor creature it is not necessary to irritate once again. Let grumbles. It as can does the hard business. In a consolation we will leave it a typographical error in date of death of the cardinal. Here it has a lawful opportunity to blow out cheeks of "the professional historian" and to feel the indispensability. Conversation absolutely on another. About things much more difficult and important. And the historian in such conversation it is already inappropriate.4 The real problem is that my picture of trial of Galilei is in the same way false, as well as that that is offered by my reviewer. We will be frank: they are equivalent on the lameness. Neither at me, nor at it is not present nor the uniform fact. I will explain. Everything that we cannot repeatedly check and repeat, cannot be considered as the fact in strict sense of this word. And other sense, except strict, at this word, alas, does not exist. We can only assume that, perhaps, business was "so" or approximately "so". Any event, both large, and the smallest, consists of a huge set of composed. There is enough lung distortions of any of them, shifts of any accent, change of an order of nuances – and all huge picture collapses in "inaccuracy". And from inaccuracy there is one road – in"not the fact", that is in a fiction which differs from Sabbatini or Dumas's compositions only in tediousness.

The real past is scatterings of probabilities, assumptions, the indirect evidence, artifacts, scraps of memoirs, scraps of guesses, sets of baizes and ambiguous documents. These scatterings are huge but in any integral picture they back will never develop. Let's bring exemplifying. Let's assume, we would manage to collect all ringlets, ear rings, the kulonchik, cuff links and tooth crowns made of the gold extracted, for example, in veins of the Chuvalsky field. Let's assume, we would melt all this gold, partially shattered, partially baked, then otcheshuit and would try to return back to coast of the Ural small river. But as if carefully we made all these actions, to recreate a vein in all it integrity, branchiness and specificity of the chemical composition of chuvalsky gold at us will never turn out. Why? For a set of the reasons. Uniqueness of its chemical structure disappeared in crucibles of jewelers which cleared or tinted metal additives. The lovely gvozdeobraznost tiny in gold specks in ore is irrevocably lost in plavilka and retorts. To recreate it geometry only processes of a Silurian kataklaz and katagenez which any more will never repeat anew could. But even if we could at the price of some inconceivable efforts restore chemical structure and even a form gold in specks, all the same lay veins back it will not turn out. All breeds accomodating them are crushed and mixed in the course of gold mining. To return initial sloyeniye of quartz thicknesses, blendes and faded ore, we should create Earth anew. Approximately the situation and with "veins" of events of a true story also is. In many respects it is fault of historians. Wishing to make the "kulonchik or a ringlet", each of them shoveled again and split up "the containing breeds" – and only aggravated chaos. Partly it is fine. Having understood that no "facts of history" exist, we acquire the right for exclusive freedom of the treatment of past matter. Trying to find answers to various questions, today we have the right for everything: on distortions, imaginations, on application of a pure lie and any jugglings. Selecting at random "the numerical code" to the lock of this or that event, we have the right to use any "figures". As the classic characterizing history as the most senseless of disciplines fairly spoke: "Does not matter what nonsense is preferred to other nonsense". It is very heavy to reconcile to lack of the real picture of the past. Homo are trained on the fact that presence at them of "history", clear and flatter for them, is an important part of their life. To agree that the known history is, most likely, for 98% illusion roughly cooked up and repeatedly rewritten myth probably for them it will be intolerable. But sooner or later it it is necessary to make. Sometime and history will become science. Perhaps, in about two hundred years the physicist will learn to design the quantum picture of any last event. Theoretically it is not so difficult and quite real. Perhaps, these pictures will have a strict posloynost, and the science will learn "to otlistyvat" quadrillions of such pictures and to behold the quantum reality which was 800, 300 or 300 000 years ago. Having learned to give it a zrimost or to decipher it mathematically, people will be able to have a look in eyes to an ergaster, to learn whether there was in reality a fight at Thermopylae and to count the number of breasts of Anna Boleyn. Statements, conjectures and assumptions will find checkability. In the history there will be facts – and it at last will become science. However, in order that it occurred, the whole generation of freaks has to come. Same fearless and fanatical, as Copernicus, Galilei, Darwin, Vagener, Agassis, Everi, Gamov, Shliman and Faraday. However, to new freaks it will be heavier as a hrebtina of the dotsensky world with times significantly added Galilei's dispute with Vatican to durabilities and thickness.

Especially dangerous thinking. From history of freaks
The science laughed at Galilei, suggesting it to look at heaven not in the telescope, and in a big klistir.1 It is known that business came to an end in the fact that doctor Galilei very deeply set this клистир to the back regular learnings XVII century. She could not take out it, but over time learned them to wag friendly Max Born still in 1968 coolly noted that "the science destroys the ethical base of a civilization". Let's hope that Bourne is right and put quite so and is. Badly only the fact that the science destroys this unusable base too slowly. Let's remember that "ethics" as, however, and all other "beautiful" concepts, it is intended for the thought-up being having nothing in common with the real person. When this "base" was created, homo still knew nothing about himself. And, certainly, did not expect that from "masterpiece" he will be degraded in bright, but very aggressive animal, forever soon fateful to drag in itself property of all evolutionary chain preceding it. Humanists fondly are surprised to absolute inability of ethics seriously to influence behavior of the person. But in it there is nothing strange. Those ethics that it was thought up for Adam's great-grandsons, are unsuitable for descendants of a dimetrodon. As we see on examples of the past, the rate on this fictitious "ethical base" by all means led to the next embarrassment: in the most trifling occasion of homo filled up the planet with corpses again and again, forced, destroyed and crippled, significantly slowing down development of the look. Then he did a respite and again indulged in a favourite entertainment. However, as we know, and skill of a trupotvoreniye, incarnate in a stump of martinets and military heroics, is an essential part of "the ethical base" too. For a set of the reasons its destruction noticed by Bourne goes unacceptably slowly. There are no special hopes for fast and its effective destruction, certainly. Most likely, before the science will crush this forgery and to replace it some new basis for behavior which was more suitable real homo will be created, people will manage to choke in own pus three times. Why? First of all because of very slow development of the science. This not haste has many reasons. First of all it is, of course, very limited opportunities of a brain of the person and that "dementia" which homo inherited at immediate ancestors, millions years, being ordinary gregarious animals deathbirds. Development of science and the culture almost entirely based on a narcissistic cult of "masterpiece" brakes. Still the fact that free-thinking is not pursued with such rage anywhere as in the academic environment, and real propellers of science immediately receive a brand of "freaks" is one essential reason. To "the world of science" it is much more comfortable to any comer to be built in the marching columns associate professors, to learn their corporate chants and all life obediently "to consider the cockleshells". This greyish destiny is unenviable, but it completely insures against the most terrible charges – in occupations "pseudo science" and in "frichestvo". Destinies of Galilei and his conditional "twin" in the 20th century Oswald Theodor Everi – a fine illustration to an extensive and cautionary story of freaks.

The drama of doctor Galileo, as well as everything that belongs to history, does not contain the facts in serious sense of this word. Therefore, we can "round" several available conditional invoice, that islat the same that is bashful1 all historians do. Of course, there is a certain side in shamelessness of interpretation. it it is always pleasant to pass, but in this case it, unfortunately, it will not be required. Galilei's history, as it turn, will not lose the main outlines. Speaking about XVI and XVII centuries, we make a mistake, razmezhyovyvy science of that time and church. It is incorrect. The church and science were a single whole. In the 17th century of official scientists, focused on providing a theological picture of the world, there were thousands. Each of them had an opportunity to be published and occupy departments of the best universities. We can, of course, following tradition, to call them "skholasta", but this designation will be very conditional. Let's note that among "skholast" there were not only masters of beautiful charlatanism or podtasovshchik of the facts. Anything similar. In the majority it were absolutely conscientious researchers. Yes, they did not manage to overcome an attraction of "the Christian truth" and under it "bent and prepared" natural sciences. But they did it quite sincerely and selflessly. Official science of Vatican was also considered as real learning, and such as Bruno, Copernicus, Galilei and Vezaly, had reputation of "freaks", the exotic heat-spots which swelled up on a noble nose of original knowledge. Copernicus not casually so long delayed publications of the opening, understanding that De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium Libri Sex will be competently mocked and announced by a pseudo science. He wrote: "I am frightened by a thought of contempt because of Novizna and differences of my theory".2 As it became clear a bit later, Copernicus appeared the rights. Its work for long time became subject not to the academic discussions, and only sneers. Many mocked at it. From authors popular дидaktichesky poems and encyclopedias3 to science pillars.4 From the church point of view no special crime in Copernicus's work was observed. Father Lev X belonged to it it is ironic, but is very benevolent, and the pontifical curia supported him. In 1532 Copernicus's system was officially presented on readings in the Vatican gardens, and not someone, and personal secretary fathers. By Kopernikanstvo in general it was perceived complacently until the situation was aggravated by the rowdy Bruno who declared himself his faithful adherent. In the 16-17th centuries the scientific jealousy already existed. "Experts" were able to protect "possession" from any strangers. To acquire the right to vote in science, it was necessary atto mknut to the corresponding caste,5 certainly, completely dividing it views on all key questions. Also tactics of neutralization of the dissidents and newcomers who illegally made the way in discipline was fulfilled. It was primitive, but it worked. The caste skillfully used tactical advantages of "height". She arranged the academic disorder of new views, and then surely lowered the assessment "the floor below", to belltto rist, press and intellectuals.6 Those, a little understanding in a question essence, but trusting to ranks and titles

willingly began persecution, for few years turning practically any innovator into a laughing-stock. So repeated from century to century. To Copernicus, certainly, remembered that he is churchwarden, but in astronomy – the layman; Galilei was recommended to look more often in клистир, but not in the telescope, hinting at its main profession. Periodically there were desperate characters who tried to break ridges and the academic caste, and it to podpevala. If business reached open and persistent opposition, then firewood was used. As set Bruno's example, five woodpiles were enough to stop any dispute which became uncomfortable for academicians. Galilei's drama is отнюдь not the conflict of church and knowledge.1 Of course, the Christian component in this history was, but at all not it was a dominant. Galilei's drama is mainly intra scientific opposition; it is a fight of noble academism with the impudent "freak" who for some reason encroached on sensible and as then it seemed, very perspective ideas of the Universe. Let's look narrowly. Accusers and the judge Galilei – it is exclusive scientists. Let you be not misled by their church and hierarchical titles. Initiating and a vozglathe father Urban VIII twisting process2 – famous astronomer of the time, convinced геоцентрик, Aristotle and Ptolemaeus's follower. By the way, Urban VIII with extreme sharpness condemned "hunting for witches" in Germany and the first reduced budgets of provincial consistories of inquisition. Barberini, before became the father, many years was on friendly terms with Galilei and even devoted to him delighted stanzas. Friends long and passionately argued on "a structure of the sky". Moreover, that work of Galilei that became the main subject of discussion on process, was made according to direct instructions of Urban who suggested to Galilei to compare Ptolemaeus and Copernicus's systems in fundamental work. As we see, the main character of process, the father Urban VIII, categorically it does not suit for a role of the fanatic obscurantist. The second for the importance3 the character – the great inquisitor, the cardinal Roberto Bellarmino. Both parties constantly referred to his opinion during inquiry. It was not just wellknown scientist, but real star of academism. And too if not the friend, then Galilei's friend. Its relation to a kopernikanstvo as to a scientific hypothesis was not "inquisitorial" unambiguous at all. It in the time scolded the astronomer for excessive commitment to the entertaining, but "pseudoscientific" idea of the movement of Earth and suggested Galilei to find proofs more convincingly, than simple references to Copernicus. Still in 1616 Bellarmino drew the scientific conclusion in which it was in black and white traced: "If to tell that the assumption of the movement of Earth and an immovability of the Sun allows to present all phenomena better, than acceptance of clowns and epicycles, then it will be told perfectly and not attracts for any danger. For the mathematician of it it is quite enough".4 Other persons involved in process, both the direct, and correspondence, participating in it the works or consultations, entirely mathematicians, mechanics and astronomers. The Jesuit Horatio Grassi was a researcher of the nature of comets, and Kiaramonti – the creator of the fundamental

work De tribus stellis quae annuis. Scientific was so high avtoritет F. Bonaventura, J. Polakko,1 V. Magno, Klaviya,2 A. Foskarini and other accusers and careful defenders. None of these scientists husbands would not begin to challenge sphericity of Earth, length it equatorial circle or the fact of the movement of planets. They perfectly knew Eratosthenes Kirensky, Aristotle, Ptolemaeus, Kepler's works and easily drew geocentric schemes Quietly to Braga. Any of these "skholast" could prove mathematically that коперникоvsky3 tables of location of planets have a number of the essential defects noticeable to any "real" astronomer. Skholasta in perfection knew modern to them physics, therefore, were convinced that the body possesses only one type of the movement and already for this one reason Earth cannot rotate at the same time around own axis and move around the Sun. They sincerely believed that on their party not only scientific artful designs, but also the most ordinary common sense: under their legs nothing rotated, and planets obviously turned around Earth, moving away, coming nearer. The Kopernikovsky system on which Galilei's views were based for "skholast" was the mistake which is already handed over in archive because of the absurd. And obstinacy of Galilei who is fanatically betrayed by it – the antiscientific trick of darling, but "the gone balmy old man" which is slowing down development of natural sciences. All of us somehow forgot partially that as an essential argument in favor of the proof of rotation of Earth Galilei showed existence on it … inflows and otliv. At the same time he categorically denied influence of the Moon on these phenomena. The inaccuracy of this argument already then was obvious. Galilei, as well as any homo, in general was able and liked to be mistaken. It did it is juicy and is furious. In a scientific dispute with Orazio Grassi, scientist Jesuit,4 Galileo claimed that comets are evaporations of the earth, "heating up for account the exclusive softness". Grass objected: comets are the quite real space bodies having the orbits. Galilei very caustically derided the Jesuit, but as it became clear subsequently, Orazio was right after all. We repeat: of course, in process also the church dogmatics, but only for the reason were mentioned that the Bible in general was a point counting that time, including for science. But if the conflict of heliocentricism and articles of belief, and accusers – church fanatics was an essence of process, then Galilei would be burned without any interviews, disputes and admonitions. The main riddle of this court – the most rough violation of all rules and the principles of inkvizitsionny inquiry. Having established a crime against bases of belief and having obtained its incontestable evidence in the form of recognition, Urban VIII was obliged to send Galilei on fire. However it did not happen. The heretic who was in time to spread around the views in the book was not even it is concluded at least for a year of murus largus, that is so-called"lung imprisonment", assuming the dry camera, without arresting to a wall, a floor or a ceiling. It should be noted that process of inquiry was made not in cellars of inquisition, and in one of the Roman palaces. Galilei carried out under the lock of all several days after the third5 interrogation. Five-room palace rooms overlooking the Vatican gardens were the place of its short conclusion. Galilei was given the servant and the valet.

A bit later the father was tired to overpersuade the old man, flared up and showed in protection of the geocentric theory a set of tweezers from torment arsenal of inquisition.1 This argument seemed to Galilei so convincing that he recognized scientific correctness of the old friend Barberini at once. After renunciation Galilei was sent "under house arrest" to Alchetri's estate where to the death lived with relatives, servants, with the right to receive guests and to research. It is impossible to explain also the fact that no penance was assigned to Galilei though any violator of border of church canons was at least kept saying to a stripe on clothes yellow the circles and crosses notifying that their carrier is guilty in "some" heresy. As you can see, once we looked narrowly more attentively, having rejected stereotypes, and before our eyes Galilei's history turned into a trivial shop squabble of astronomers, into a competition of hypotheses which was formally won by Vatican which branded views of the opponent "pseudo science". "the heliocentric drama" differs from what occurs in Cambridge or Milan university today only in presence of imperious opportunities at one of the discussing parties. Anything more. Father at the same time led not as church hierarch, and as knight and scientist. Sentence to Galilei2 – it is a brilliant sample of the academic courtesy and nobility. If we look for analogs of galileevsky history in "light scientific centuries", then we will find them without any work. But we will not see either generosity, or pity to the opponent any more. The winner of the Stalin award professor Olga Lepeshinskaya, the dear professor Von Gebra, the director of Institute of genetics of Academy of Sciences of the USSR T. D. Lysenko, the leading biochemist of Rock Feller institute A. Mirsky, and also the Linnean gentleman, the head of naturalhistorical department of the British museum R. Owen – at an opportunity to reach "administratively" the opponent and to destroy it proved much more meanly and more rigidly, than inquisitors of the XVII century. However, we will not follow "bloody" axioms when carriers of the highest scientific degrees negodyaynichat to the full extent, sending discordant with their hypotheses on prisons, camps and psychiatric hospitals. Let's take "peace" Theodor Oswald Everi's history,3 which in the XX century almost "literally" repeated Galileo Galilei's drama. Ewer long before Watson and Shout understood a role of deoxyribonucleic acid and proclaimed that DNA and is that "the transforming agent", the managing director of proteins and their order. On the trouble, Everi not only declared, but also in detail proved that DNA is responsible for storage and transfer of genetic information. The experience delivered to them with pnevmokokkovy bacteria was4 more than convincing. Ewer extracted DNA from a strain of pnevmokokkovy bacteria which had capsules around cages and therefore were called "smooth". Everi entered this DNA in those cages of pneumococci that had no capsules. The essential number of descendants of usual bacteria turned into smooth. What as a result happened to Everi? It was humiliated in all ways, torn to pieces and thrown out from science. Who made it? Pop obscurantists? No. It was made by the most authoritative and sweetest Alfred Mirsky, the leading biochemist of Rock Feller institute who arranged persecution with "rappberry", beaters and "shooters on numbers". He confirmed once again that he is the master of organization of scientific process, having mobilized for meek Everi's persecution practically all geneticists and biochemists of

England and America. Opinion that "Everi in science not the place" became popular, and his name – nominal for designation of "freak". Direct administrative pressure was accurately added to mockeries, Everi's benefit was the employee of Rock Feller institute. Theodor Oswald who made one of the most important for all history of science of opening was not neither a fighter, nor to stands. It did not differ in bravery and ability for itself(himself) at all to stand. Broken by persecution, it renounced from the opening, having recognized it false, and in connection with "loss of the scientific authority" left the academic world, left and completely stopped all researches. He lived still several years, without touching neither to any literature, nor with whom, without contacting and without being interested in anything. His members of household knew that any conversation on genes, acids and proteins causes silent tears and long catalepsy in Theodor Everi. It is still unknown whether learned in general Everi that his opening was unconditionally confirmed, and it is nominated for the Nobel Prize. To it Ervin Chargaff tried to break through, but Everi refused to communicate, and soon died. There are tens of examples such. Everyone is connected with opening in the most important questions of knowledge. And each of them is the evidence of desperate impudence of those who were not afraid of charges of a pseudo science, brands of "freak" and contempt associate professor's masses. Of course, there is always a risk to be the real fool and, having stepped through all "continuous", to remain a laughing-stock. But it already as "the card will lay down".

Russia in search of hell
Some phenomena become more clear through analogy. To understand that why and why suddenly in Russia Iosif Vissarionovich was dug out, we will remember one old, but effective experiment with spiders. So, let's choose in family ликозид1 the most aggressive male and it is accurate let's separate to it tips педипальп.2 Then sdawe bark to a spider a podex section3 and let's take hardly visible sexual channels. Lancet let's transfer them on fragment of glass and there we will put separated pedipalpa. Certainly, the sexual still life created by us externally will significantly lose to live to excited to arakhnid, totory we will place near стёklyshky. But if all of us made correctly and chose for preparation really the most spiteful male, then the control samochka-likozida will choose our still life. The live male will be ignored by it. The poor creature will begin to miss, and all his eight eyes, one by one, will sadly go out. And here a samochka, breaking pads and shivering, will get used to glass the gonopor, stubborn trying to copulate with a smell dead villain. All this bears a strong resemblance to the new "choice of Russia" which does not hide sympathy for Joseph Stalin today. Certainly, сколькabout the Russian Federation "crawled the back on стёklyshka", she will not become pregnant nobody similar to Vissarionovich. But she crawls. It in obvious melancholy … and hunting. It seems that one thousand years of continuous rapes and a beating did not pass for it for nothing. At it the resistant habit to be a bat was developed, and it needs the one who will be able поизгаляться over it really. Putin, apparently, is not perceived by Russia in this quality. The

country does not see in it the real, high-quality tyrant capable to lap also tastefully in it blood as it was done by Iosif. Of course, Russia can be understood. Again it becomes boring for it. A national economic apocalypse for which approach everything that is possible was made, somehow silly "hanged"; nasty Maya with the promised "doomsday" of a nadurila, and long-awaited war decayed as plywood Armata. Any other national entertainments for "people-bogonostsa" it is not looked through in the near future. There was only a smell dead Vissarionych to whom Russia decided to be given defiantly for the lack of other available entertainments. There is nothing especially tragic in it. For a set of the reasons to reconstruct original Stalinism in country scales it is impossible today. But the phenomenon of "neostalinism" observed nowadays is quite worthy researches. Of course, it is decorative, but will not refuse to it significance and ability to characterize a people at large. This condition of Russia especially is curious that a Stalinism infection goes obviously not from the Kremlin, and itself arises in "a national subsoil". In what mystery of Stalin charm? Despite crucially the inflated bubble of "a victory cult", Iosif Vissarionovich as "commander-in-chief" seriously it is apprehended cannot be in any way. "Pirrovost" of this victory is too obvious. Otherwise it should not spin around it such powerful cocoon of protective lies and legislatively to defend a victory from any serious researches it nature. Of course, "fans firm hands" do not admit it, but above-mentioned "pirrovost" – for a long time an open secret, and over time it, of course, will cease to hesitate. However, and today absence at Iosif though some talents of a military leader already too obviously. Therefore, business at all not in "victory". Matter in another. Representatives of the people-bogonostsa have an invincible need to humiliate each other, being a natural consequence of a peculiar development of the state organism and a cult of a nachalstvovaniye. But an opportunity is juicy to be humiliated appears not always. Very often it remains only dream. And here Stalin was capable to this Russian dream to attach the real wings. Therefore he is also dear as big scientist, as the inventor of a way to give to the people the chance to satiety to drink blood each other, almost without risking anything. Naturally, someone had to summarize and artly issue this invention to preserve, and as required to have an opportunity to transfer it from generation to generation. Certainly, it is most intellectuals applied handles to preservation and revival of memory of Stalin with it affected love to history and "memory preservation" by means of plates, candles and poems. it sobbing "Arkhipelaggulagi" not only carefully held in remembrance "the national blood-sucker", but also made it instructive and … seductive. It is necessary to understand that literature of this sort serves including as excellent methodical material. All these sobbings much more are textbooks for future repressor, than caution for the possible victims. They learn that in Russia mass humiliation of each other is quite feasible and can be absolute with impunity. And to appear as the executioner, but not the victim, it is necessary to choose only correctly the party and sometimes to show elementary skills of a holuystvo. And still such reading is useful also for the potential victims. They study too: humility in passing of stages, to ability to die in the exposed to frost barracks, there is a solid oil and to revel in own spirituality. Moreover, an opportunity to put puzzles of events was finally issued today. Now all precisely know, punishment for repressions will look how exactly if history repeats. Fearful vengeance of the intellectuals will be the answer to millions of the killed, zapytanny, frozen, raped and mutilated.

In about eighty years it will screw some plates on some entrances. And in the same place, in revenge to executioners, will read poems. It is silly to assume that all these juicy nuances remain the unnoticed very bright and frankly missing people. It is worth to remember that once he was very inspired strochitel of 23 000 000 denunciations, with enthusiasm froze on machine-gun towers of camps and thriftily started paws in pants tear-stained to wives political convicts. It is unlikely something significantly changed in its nature. Perhaps, dreams new generations still are not too concrete. They still did not feel ecstasy a denunciation. Also did not think of how it will be pleasant to observe the neighbor in "elitka" who is taken away in the middle of the night by citizens with Mausers. And in vain did not think. Possibly, it would allow them to feel more sharply the participation in great destiny of the great country. Yes would resolve an old dispute with the neighbor on the parking space. They do not understand yet in what attractiveness of an image of Iosif is concluded for them. Perhaps, they never will also understand it. What, however, will not prevent them to rub further "the back about fragment of glass».

Jesus Tangeyzerovich Chaplin
Jesus X. returned to media space. Thanking Tangeyzeram and Sharli this character of Hebrew folklore significantly refreshed the rating and on recognition almost caught up with Milonov, Gundyaev and Kobzon. In this regard the question became pertinent: and who is he, as a matter of fact, such? And on what basis his name was placed so close to titanic figures "Russian mira"? As it became clear, nobody can give the distinct answer to this simple question. Of course, there is an initial characteristic of Jesus X. It is that very furious deity by the name of Jehovah certain not explained in the way – it is probable, passing a vagina, fallopiyeva of a pipe and a funnel, – it was installed in a uterus of the Jewish girl and for some reason spent standard nine months of the prenatal period there. Most likely, Jehovah was forced to pass all relying embryogenesis stages. Having been born a usual order, the deity received a new "terrestrial" name – Jesus, and after a while got a profession of the rabbi, i.e. teacher and interpreter of the Torah, allocated the right to preach in synagogues. Apparently, having despaired to re-educate "peculiar people" by means of floods, rains of fire and massacre, the deity decided to talk some sense them personal execution of notations about love for the neighbor – very providently without having concretized who this "neighbor" is and who does not. Further the drama typical for that excited time was played: feasts, treacheries, sermons, healings, loose women, circulations on water, castigations, bagryanitsa and chaotic marshirada from one village to another. As a result omnipotent and essentially immortal deity played a performance of own death before enemies and admirers. It could not die in any way and under no circumstances, about what knew. At least owing to what was Almighty and immortal God, a sozdatel and manager of the whole world.1 After small term already buried deity completely restored all the physiological functions and in full health appeared before public then, including the mission of ended, "rose". About rise, that is, most likely, about vertical take-off, we have no data. The gospel avariciously establishes the fact"take-off", the uniform word without concretizing the deity speed,

its trajectory, the direction and other parameters flight. Strictly speaking, before us good experience of extreme tourism, but other characters of world religious folklore made focuses not less original, than Jesus. As we see, a question who is in general such, so far remains without answer. Long time Jesus X. appeared only in Popovskikh spells and to very few people it was interesting, except so-called "believers". However, even they especially did not go deep into details of an origin of the idol and into its commercial value. That Jesus X. regularly "passed from hand to hand" cinema-men, estradnik and painters, all treated calmly. Not bad it turned out to work for Jesus with "pepper", without special expenses introducing tragic element in any nonsense. Now the situation exchanged. At last reached churchmen, "who is such", and the handsome Chaplin led popovsky shelves on storm of a provincial teatrik which decided to add a piquancy to some opera boredom. It is necessary to understand that popovsky plaints about "an insult of feelings", as well as all on light, have simple financial background. Actually Jesus X. is a quite good brand. Of course, it is not so successful as the Coca-Colas badge or a strange kozyabra of General Electric. But you will not refuse to it recognition and, respectively, profitability. Let's note that popovsky offense on directors, estradnik and the novelists cutting the image untwisted by church it is absolutely fair. Bottoms during many hundreds of years invested in Jesus X., financing creation it uncountable images, and also devoted to it songs, buildings, chants and representations. Now they would like to use Jesus individually, squeezing out of this brand everything for themselves. Tangeyzerny scandal showed that bottoms with anybody do not intend to share Jesus. It is clear. Only savage style of churchmen is unclear. Instead of legally issuing the the exclusive right "on any images and mentions" Jesus X., they began to scribble slanders again, to row and shake by articles of the Criminal Code. It is necessary to give them all rights for this brand. Let individually use it. They it deserved. Possibly, Jesus's image quickly will choke in vacuum of church. But the trouble is small. We not bad know those components from which he is brought together. It is impossible to find an image which would be so secondary and collective as Jesus X. Impudence with which its evangelical "biography" was sewed from scraps of the semi-strangled magics and dead cults, it is possible to excuse only haste with which new belief, and also need to type though some biographic invoice for a new deity was created. Let's look narrowly. From the assiro-Babylon god Marduk to evangelical Jesus got in "inheritance": a clownish crowning, a bagryanitsa, beatings, a crown of thorns, an execution, rescue of the people from anger of evil spirits at the price of the life, the policemen at a tomb who are running up in horror at the sight of the revived dead person, and even entry into the city on a burro. From Phoenician Adonis and the Thracian Dionysus – all history with the dumped funeral veils, circulation on water, a cave coffin, and also some nuances of revival. From Phrygian Attis – water "baptism", transformation of water into wine, three-day the term of stay in death before "revival", farewell "secret" vespers with pupils and "participle". From the Greek Asclepius – ways of healing of the blind man by means of a pasting to it a century saliva. From Gore, Dionysus and Hermes – the birth in a shed. From the Mitre, Gore and Krishna – astrologers- the magicians who visited newborn god in "den", and also Christmas "star" and all history with beating of babies and flight.

"Moral" part of the Gospel entirely of a plagiatirovan from the Egyptian and mitraistsky sources, and the fact "rises" are only deification of the old kind levitation described still Lukian in his story about "giperboreysky conjurers". Let's note that all mentioned gods were uprightly conceived, were born in a cave or in a shed from mothers virgins; the demon or an evil ghost offered all of them wealth and the power; all were able to go on water, to fly and cure; all died in "atonement" something, but not just like that, and all, certainly, revived. Ideologists of Christianity found a charming explanation of scandalous "coincidence" for a long time. According to Tertullian and other "fathers of church", certainly, it "intrigues of a devil and demons". "To mock at Christ and to force people to consider that Christians only copy faith in pagan gods, demons became inspirers of mythology. Demons in advance knew what Christians and therefore they invented similar myths and ceremonies and artfully a razygra will teach towhether them prior to evangelical events".1 It is clear, that each of the mentioned deities was not independently and originally too. Attis, Dionysus, the Mitre, Osiris and so forth, in turn, "are made" of elements of the predecessors, gods still earlier and probably more primitive which genealogies leave to spirits of the Neolithic. Certainly, any deity has "expiration date". Sometimes it comes to an end together with features of a century which generated it and cultivated, sometimes the deity naturally loses credibility and is cancelled. And new era tears overdue gods on лоскутья to sew from them something fashionable and brand new. Of course, it will be very difficult to design essentially new deity. All лоскутья are too well-known, and set them is limited. But from this difficult situation nevertheless there is an exit. Opera which is looking for symbols of original dramatic nature to directors, pathos novelists and culture in general should look narrowly at the Chukchi Pivchunin. This god was famous for the tiny sizes – according to different data, from 3 to 12 cm. It skillfully used the diminutiveness, imperceptibly getting under skirts and into rima pudenti of virgins. Having appeared there, certainly, he made immaculate conception. Vicious it was difficult to it because of small growth.

Little fool Clio, or why history should not be studied at schools
The known phrase "The people which are not knowing the the past, has no future" is only figure of speech also does not contain in general any sense Disintegrations of the big states are good already what along with various dramas they offer still and set of top-quality puzzles. Today too all goes without a hitch. Having curled up, the rachitic economy resignedly dies. Near, having buried in empty nipples, die it "puppies". That is any there illusions, sciences, hopes, rights, plainnesses and laws. Martinets, shining cockardes and moving with moustaches, are under construction for the "last and resolute" a cancan. They are not confused by the fact that in the 21st century to kankanirovat it is necessary not under Offenbach, and under Geyger. But besides these the "small pleasures" typical for a distemper of the 21st century, are formed as we already spoke, and very curious puzzles. Quite worthy studying. In particular, to it the attack of public rage addressed to the whole world around belongs. This rage is irrational and inexplicable, and speed it distribution bewitches. Usually it is called as the beautiful word

"patriotism", but an essence it from it does not change. It remains pure rage, slightly podslashchyonny national narcissism and hysterical humility to "administration". Approximately the same already was in Russia about hundred years ago. But then this phenomenon was not managed to be surveyed somehow.1 Such epidemic of rage – extremely curious phenomenon. Not absolutely it is clear it origin and causes. Also remains riddle, in what she derives strength for the triumphal procession along the country. Certainly, some role in it distribution promotion plays. But this role is not so big as it is accepted to think. It is known that the pornographic magazine is capable to cause an erection, but it can grow up to nobody a penis. It is not necessary to write down in distributors of epidemic and church. Of course, excitement of rage is a direct obligation of this organization, but influence of church remains insignificant. The poor creature Gundyaev both sat, and sits, having embraced the one and only percent of rating of "national trust". Suspiciously easy the answer to our question of an origin of hysterical humility of Russians to the administration is offered by sociology. Really, according to VCIOM, in many years of throwings and passions, in 2015 the Russian society stiffened in familiar figures: 85% of obedient and 15% rebellious. I will remind, during very long time approximately the ratio of serf people and free citizens in imperial Russia was it. Agree, analogy significant and very flatter for modern freethinkers. But! This version cannot be supported by data of genetics. More likely, on the contrary: DNA is not engaged in such trifles as transfer of class features. So this hypothesis it is necessary to reject, and to write off similarity of figures for amusing coincidence. And still we will try to understand this phenomenon. At the same time we are obliged to remember that our "calculations of the reasons" can be and wrong. The simple thinking is the worst type of mathematics. Using it, we are doomed to replace the accuracy of numbers with poor words and indistinct concepts. Even if, conforming to the rules of mathematics, we will be scrupulously to delete from thinking all "personal", that any annoying mistake is all the same possible. And still we will try. So, in than the reason of that epidemic of rage which is called "patriotic rise"? At first sight everything is very simple. There is a clear interrelation: the I.Q. of an individual, the higher is lower it the need to feel the belonging to strong and numerous pack. This normal homo property inherited from thousands of ancestral generations. Than pack growing furious and more shamelessly, that participation in it becomes more sweet. There is a pack cult which is senseless for exposing. Let's note that to the word "pack" we can pick up any epithet: "people", "nation", "fatherland". The essence from it will not change. But! Not always everything develops as it would be desirable homo. For various reasons the "native" pack can be embarrassed, weakened or "lowered". In this case it would be logical to individual to adjoin other, more successful community and again to find "comfort of participation". But it is not always possible as language, financial and geographical nuances interfere lung to transitions from one pack to another. What to do in that case? Whether there is a medicine allowing to satisfy this "national pain" which can be and very sharp? Certainly, is. If today's progress of pack is very modest, then in the course goes so-called "history". Drawing stately pictures old and recent, it, contrary to any evidence, helps an individual to feel as a part of the strong and aggressive community experiencing

only temporary difficulties again. In it the magic power and attractiveness of history are also concluded, and also it main function. The matter is that the respectful passion to the past has no other rational explanation. Moreover, from the point of view of common sense the respect for the past can be characterized only as a strange perversion. Let's explain. Remembering Napoleon or Suvorov, we, of course, can be touched to gloss of buttons on their uniforms. But at the same time it is worth to remember that the speech goes about the beings who are at much lower level of human evolution. "Person" is only what he knows. And these characters did not know still too much of what became today a platitude. Respectively, their perception of the world, their reflection and behavior were significantly more primitive than ours. Nevertheless the cult of history is strong and popular. The reason of this popularity is partly clear. Now let's consider quality of the cult. Mnemozina and Zeus's daughter quiet girl Clio thought the Greek mifologist as the person strict and decent. To it it was imputed a duty to hold a slate pencil and a roll, and also by an important maiden voice to list merits of the forgotten dead persons. Of course, she had to look good, but at the same time not allow nobody to lift up the marble hem. So it probably also was if Clio as it the sister Urania, became the goddess of astronomy or sponsored the tragedy as Melpomene. But the girl on the trouble became the goddess of history. Here also it became clear that, for the known reasons, it all as all need the heroic past want. Original or fictional. Three thousand years of continuous rapes changed character of "the girl with a roll". Clio learned to accept on click by fingers the necessary poses. And depending on penetration depth – to let out orgazmichesky cries strictly according to the tyrant's wishes. With the known share of confidence it is possible to claim that not less than 99% of so-called "history" are just references of one visionaries to others. History did not get any sign of science: it does not comprise any checked and repeated components and cannot be subjected to the experimental analysis. Yes, there are artifacts, raskopochny material and material certificates. But, as we know, it is possible to treat them in any convenient way. In all respects history is only a kind of the fiction which is specially adapted for a consolation of the nations in their difficult moments. And here the original past of mankind which is squeezed out by the necessary and beautiful myths, most likely, is lost already irrevocably. Let's take the next to us a large-scale historical event – World War II. Even here we will see that the most part of the facts already successfully and is irreparably deformed. Butchers and marauders are turned into great commanders, real heroes are changed convenient, and the most important reasons of a victory are accurately forgotten. If we move slightly more deeply in centuries, then we will find increase of this deformation of the facts. There is already a full altering of the sense of events. For example, tragic, but from it not less shameful defeat of the Russian army at Borodin turned into "a victory of the Russian weapon". Of course, here it was not without Tolstoy and other pereplavshchik of the historical invoice in a fiction. However, always writers managed what was too hard to historians. Let's remember False Dmitriy. Almost in hundred years prior to Peter I it began to reform Russia: opened borders, allowed circulation of all currencies, legalized music and painting, wrote out scientists from Poland and Germany, planned creation of universities, took away the income from priests, renamed the Duma into the Senate, began reform of army. But for the poet Pushkin False Dmitriy is a dirty Grishka, the primitive adventurer trying to mutilate a face of "sacred Russia". And here Pyotr I which did exactly the same, as False Dmitriy, – the hero and the genius.

47

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

How it could turn out? Very simply. At that time there was already "a cultural tradition" of admiration of Pyotr and indignations of False Dmitriy. As we can be convinced, this tradition drove the poet on very short lead, at discretion forcing it either to lick, or to oblaivat various characters. Proceeding from all these axioms, we have the right to assume that on a measure still bigger "deepening in the past" deformation of the facts increases in a geometrical progression, completely distorting and remaking everything that is possible. Possibly, we never learn what actually was the Russian history. It annoyingly, but is no tragedy in it. We understand that knowledge of ancestral forms is not an indispensable condition for continuation of development of a look. And for public there is a specific myth which is successfully satisfying it "national pains". The myth furious and primitive, built only on blood, boasting, bayonets, an unceasing robbery of neighbors and unprecedented "greatness". Possibly, it it also feeds the next attack of public rage. It is possible to remove an attack. But for this purpose it is necessary to remove or to considerably change the myth which Russians seriously consider the "historical memory". Better, of course, not to do it as instead of this myth there is nothing to offer. But, once again sparing it, nevertheless it is necessary to remember that such "past" will always have forces to strangle any future.

Theory and practice of blasphemy. Part 1
All cults and religions have one small problem. It consists in absence of god per se, and also any indirect signs of his existence. This annoying trifle, of course, irritates believers. However, not always. They already learned to be reconciled with this fact, but very much worry when they learn others about it. It seems to believers that when the true situation opens, they with the candles, a cult of dried dead persons and turbans look silly. The secret of absence of god, of course, can be masked chewing gum of magnificent ceremonies, ritual dances or demagogy about "spirituality". It is possible. But only to certain minutes. And it comes sooner or later, and then practical lack of a deity becomes obvious to all and everyone. Agree, for the believer this not too pleasant moment. Exposed by the little fool, he, as a rule, falls into rage, a catto Oroya1 it can be realized both through simple scandal, and through turn from AKM. There are many various ways to bare the juicy fact of a bogootsutstviye. But only good, juicy blasphemy has universal ability to place points over i in this question. Why? Because, having directly touched the personal dignity of god, blasphemy, in principle, has to provoke it to immediate reciprocal actions. In fact, god receives a clip. Of course, he can put the tail between the legs and keep silent, but for a being with such terrible and bloody image as, for example, at iudeo-Christian god, it is not too decent pose. Silence and inaction of a deity in this case works for its desacralization, i.e. for a rassvyashchenivaniye. The professional reputation of god which is strong driven in consciousness of public falls. Authors of religions wrote off the main lines of gods with themselves. Therefore vindictiveness, suspiciousness and hysteria became characteristics and supernatural characters. Of course, there are variations. There are cults more softly and more rigidly. But here the Judaism, Christianity and Moslem got to a trap of own promotional campaign long ago. They, unlike other religions, intercepted the retreat of themselves everyones, having thought up for

themselves not just very spiteful, but still and extremely whimsical god. Their god absolutely it is deprived sense of humour, and 80% of its lexicon are a blackmail and bloody threats. Of course, all deities, from Buddhist Palden Lkhamo to the Chukchi Pivchunin, squabble, isterikut and exterminate people. But Zeus at least periodically is distracted by insemination of the stood gaping Greek women, Palden spends a part of time for tailoring of accessories from the son's skin, and here bible god has no other occupations, except narcissism and intimidation of poor homo. Itself is approved it it is exclusive by means of massacre and raspaltsovka. And that, and another, judging by the Bible, made mad success at cattle-farmers of antiquity: "Also I will pour out on you indignation mine, I die on you fire my rage … You will be food to fire, your blood will remain on the earth, not will and remember about to you, because, I, the Lord, told it".1 "Also you will eat flesh of your sons and плfrom your daughters you will eat"2 "Old man, young man and maiden, and baby and wives beat to death".3 "Who in the distance, that will die from Morava ulcers; and who it is close, that will fall from a sword, and remained and escaped will die for hunger… also you learn that I am a Lord …".4 This god who even is not offended by anything throws stones from the sky, waters people fire or sends on them epidemics, wars and misfortunes.5 It can dry a tree, without having found on it in March fruits, and the lady who looked back to the flaring house, click пальцев turns into a salt pillar.6 Without any reasons he destroys the whole cities and cuts out the people, and once arranges massacre of all mankind in general. In Flood waters the bible deity coolly heats all, including babies, pregnant ladies and ancient old women, having made an exception only for the authorized representative by name Ache. Let's note that the Bible offers us very specific picture of disaster. All attention is focused on a ship where animals and Noyevo family comfortably settled down. Hundreds of thousands, and it is possible, millions of children and adults dying at this moment hard are awarded only a negligent mention: "any being who was on a surface was exterminated lands; from the person to the cattle …".7 Innocent joke of rural children in an adrafrom his other authorized representative8 too causes immediate reaction of god. But as he invents some new ways of murders all the time, kids are not burned down with sulfur and not heated, and tear she-bears. "Also two she-bears came out of the wood and tore to pieces from them forty two child».9 God and she-bears probably melancholically pick after that teeth, having provided to mothers to collect and mourn remains of the broken-off kids. In general, according to "Scripture", children are a special weakness of Christian god. He loves and is able to destroy them. We the truth do not know in what way боkilled all firstborns in Egypt.10 But the mass face of babies is its image action for which he carefully prepared, discussing it with Moisey. "Scripture"

of Christians diplomatically reports only that "the great cry in the earth Egyptian because was not at home became" where there would be no little dead person. Lovethe l god to be delayed on babies,1 but not обделяl attention and vnutriutrobnik.2 About it in the book of the prophet Hosea especially juicy expression is used – "to cut pregnant women". However, the broken-off children, massacre and a nasylaniye of epidemics is a regular repertoire. Just for maintenance in public of due degree of "God's fear" and an enduring reminder on "its greatness". The real hysterics of a deity begins when he in this or that form receives a clip. I.e. becomes an object of sneers or direct mockery. Naturally, none of characters of "Scripture" call god "idiot". Nobody draws on it caricatures. Hebrew blasphemies have very delicate nature. But! Even attempt it is simple to glance in "Ark of the Covenant" causes immediate and very spiteful reaction of god: "Also it struck Vefsamis's inhabitants that they looked in an ark and killed five from the peopledesit seventy thousand people".3 The amusing trick of the boys Nadava and Abihu who dared to incense some not that incense leads to the fact that "and there was fire from the Lord and burned them also died they in the face of Lord's".4 We can show a set of such examples, on even these are enough to make idea of character and Jehovah-Sabaoth-Jesus's bents. Within twenty centuries its image of the lightning and ruthless chastener was carefully supported and cultivated by church. Naturally, any innocent joke to god has to and guarantee to the impudent person transformation into a handful of dust today. And immediately. And in case of a direct insult of "God's majesty" heaven has to burst, and archangels – to take swords fiery and to chop the man of Belial on one hundred fried pieces. Splitting of cult boards5 on an opening day would have to come to the end with streams of the flaring sulfur from heaven. And a song in HHS – an instant breaking of scoffers, at least, in two. But … songs "pussy" sound, icon chips fly, felt-tip pens of Sharli creak – and nothing occurs. Shestikryly seraphs do not fly and shestnadtsatiglazy cherubs do not open wide heaven. The bloody show which is repeatedly promised by the Bible appears only the Hebrew fairy tale. Same silly and angry, as well as figure it central character. This moment for any "believer" trained in convictions, that god is all-powerful, omniscient, and, above all, is extremely furious, almost intolerable. Of course, the sign of "absence" is obvious to it too. And then he own vanity tries to disguise that intolerable silence and dullness that comes after blasphemy. And it fills it we howl a million meeting, light-weapons fire or Marina Syrova's voice. Believers can be understood. They very much do not want to look the fools who for nothing spent life on repeating over and again forehead about a floor and kisses with dried corpses. Having some religious experience, they precisely know that as a result of blasphemy of nothing not will occur, also undertake to make his "work" the god. The situation is warmed up by bottoms. When in the usual ways to veil the fact of absence of god any more not it is possible, new articles of the Criminal code are composed, fires are kindled, and the believer think out certain "special feelings" which other people do not have. These "feelings" not bad replace today god, becoming subject to worship.

About whether there are these "feelings" actually, we will talk in the second part of our article. P. S. There is a stereotype based on initial and dogmatic ignorance. Believers fondly divide the Old and New Testament probably assuming that in them goes the speech about different gods. By no means. The special piquancy of a situation is that Jesus and a razryvatel of kids bears is the same god depending on an environment changing names and so-called. "entities". In Christianity not three gods and not two. It is one.

Theory and practice of blasphemy. Part 2
Before kissing to the priest a hand, think what it did by it five minutes ago When the simple question sounds: "And whether it is possible to offend feelings of believers?" – turn sour even most burned liberals. Ideological skewers are right there pushed in a sheath. There comes time of reservations, tens various "but" and rassharkivaniye. As a result the unintelligible bleating which is not containing in general any answer turns out. Though the answer to this question is extremely simple: in those territories where there is no direct legislative prohibition on such insult, it is possible to do it, undoubtedly. Moreover, it is necessary. And it is even necessary. Of course, there are territories which chose the destiny intellectual degradation or not having any ambitions of development. Their list is known: Bangladesh, Russia, Nigeria, Afghanistan and other powers focused on originality and spirituality. There are laws protecting "feelings of believers", certainly, are used and applied. In codes of the developed countries similar prohibitions sometimes meet,1 but generally civilized world follows decisions of the Venetian commission at the Council of Europe long ago recommending "to eliminate blasphemy of offenses". The sense of this recommendation is clear. The matter is that the right for blasphemy – much more important right, than it seems at first sight. Blasphemy – essential a free-thinking component, allowing to express laconically the the attitude towards a set of that archaic absurd that are the cornerstone of any religion. Moreover, public blasphemy is a fine way to remind believers that they are not individual owners of the world, culture and information spaces. That besides their views exist also opposite. This reminder is useful also for believers. The matter is that in favorable environments they are quickly forgotten and lose behavior reference points. What inevitably leads subsequently to dramas. We repeatedly observed how priests at first thrust all under nose hands, importunately demanding kisses, and then take offense, beholding the blood-stained stumps. Periodically натыкаясь an Adam's apple on an atheism blade, believers sober and "come back to coast". It keeps balances and allows to avoid unpleasant excesses. We come back to our subject. In the territory of the Russian Federation we, unfortunately, are deprived of an opportunity to blaspheme publicly. Why we speak "unfortunately"? Because today we need to find out whether there are at believers certain special "feelings". Of course, it would be simpler to be made on some living example. For a minute having started the blasphemy

mechanism, we easily would make out also a design of notorious "feelings". Believers are learned to respond on such provocations and the reaction always provide an excellent research materiat. But! For the known reasons1 we cannot make it and therefore we will consider the "blasphemy-a insult of feelings" mechanism, without setting it in motion at all. So to speak, in a statics. However, and the switched-off, this mechanism is clear too, and to be picked it by logic tweezers still more conveniently. So, let's assume, that "feelings of believers", i.e. certain unknown to science and feelings inaccessible to other people, really exist. In that case we deal with a phenomenon. With couple normal phenomenon, worthy careful studying. Practically each "believer" claims that existence of such "feelings" considerably distinguishes it from all other people. It serious statement. Let's note that today it is a claim for the whole set of essential privileges. What nature of these "feelings"? According to the logic of things they have to be the annex to that set of doctrines with which confession any believer begins. But if it so, then they have to be invariable in the same way as Christianity. And to have so ancient origin. In this case offensive for believers of the 4th century has to offend so strongly Jesus's admirers and in the seventeenth century. And what was intolerably for Christians of the X century – by all means has to "work" also in XXI. Whether so it? Let's look. Since 3rd century of Christians Homer, Euripides, Sophocles, Eskhil, and also all antique classics fatally offended. Why? Yes because these authors mentioned in the compositions or glorified pagan gods. Therefore Homer and other Sofoklov forbade to teach at schools, and their compositions were burned, dug in to the earth or scraped off from parchments. Those who dared to recite them or just to read, killed. The infinite number of the books containing Osiris, Zeus, Hermes's names, Mars and other competitors of Jehovah-Jesus was destroyed. Afiney Navkratissky in the "Feast of philosophers" gives rather exact numbers: he writes that about 800 names antique writers and scientists and about 1500 of their works were lost forever during punishment of followers of Jesus of antique literature. In 391 bishop Theophilus burned up Alexandria library. There were about 26 000 volumes of "offensive" literature. Blagochestiveyshy Valent ordered to collect specially across all Antioch books of the pre-Christian period and to destroy "without any trace". The father Grigory I in 590 published the dekretaliya obliging to finish "nasty thing" Gomerov, Apuleev and Democritus. In lots of the burned books quite often there was a town and for scientists that time. Though it is necessary to pay tribute to Christians: during that time they still liked to examine tortures of the insulters and preferred to kill them in some smokeless way. For example, cutting off from them meat sharp cockleshells. From live. Quite so they managed to be through with the first female astronomer Gipatiya killed according to St. Cyril of Alexandria's order. It is necessary to tell that not only books, but also all ancient art "offended feelings of believers in Christ". Followers of "presladky god" demolished temples, split up statues, washed away frescos, crumbled cameos and chopped off mosaics. Only several centuries later we see the representatives of the same belief lovingly collecting ancient Roman and Greek art. They already make glass capsules for cameos with Apollo and blow off motes from marble eyes of Athena. For some mysterious reason what so strongly tormented believers and caused them "anguish" becomes object of their admiration, studying and trade. There is lawful the first doubt available of certain special "feelings", sharply and directly connected with belief.

Further everything develops still more curiously. There comes minute when icons become the strongest insult of feelings of believers …. On a sekundochka we will glance to orthodox Byzantium the 8th century. Homer concerns nobody any more. But we see huge fires from icons. We see icon painters to whom in punishment for their creativity chopped off fingers or welded hands in boiled water. 338 pravoslavnax bishops on a cathedral 754 years1 announce icons the most terrible insult of religion and demand their elimination. Orthodox crowds ransack across all Byzantium, trying to discover an occasion to be offended more feasibly. They easily find it as icons are in each house. To that in whom in the house find the picturesque image of Jesus Iosifovich or his mother this icon is broken against the head. After breaking large fragments of once sacred boards will be earned to the back of their owners. Or in a throat. It is put on a stream and mockery over images. Over faces on icons svinosobach or "others demonsky a rylets" are drawn. 338 orthodox bishops rub pads and still light the believing crowds more diligent, in paints painting nuances of that mental anguish which has to cause truly believing an iconography. But in several years everything changes in a magic way. 338 orthodox bishops, пошушукавшись, get down to business again – and across all Byzantium the round-up of those who pricked icons and cooked in boiled water of a hand of living icon painters begins. As a result of the same Orthodox Christians who were offended by the fact of existence of icons begins to offend even a thought of their burning or splitting. New search of guilty persons begins. They are found without any work and given to drink lead fusions. The Byzantine landscape is decorated with corpses with burned mouths and interiors. It are scoffers iconoclasts. Now they cause hatred of Christians. Exactly same as icon painters and iconostases a few years ago caused. 338 orthodox bishops shine happiness, and icons appear especially esteemed objects again. Having played enough in iconoclasm, believers direct on searches of new occasions to be offended. Certainly, and new, stronger feelings, not too correctly run to look for comparison of Christians with Bandar-logs who, having pogromed and напакостничав, quickly lose interest in object of disorder. So far we will refrain from it. Let's look, what was farther. And it was farther still more interestingly. Christians began to be offended in general on everything that came to them to hand: on astronomy, chemistry, publishing, paleontology and botany. On opening of drugstores, electricity and X-rays. Let's lower axiomatic and all De Dominis, Bruno, Byuffon, Miguel Servet, Charles Estien, Ivan's known examples Fёdorova, et cetera. Let's consider less known, absolutely recent scandals. Beginning of the 19th century. Offended anatomy the Russian seminarists under guidance of the Kazan bishop Ambrose rush on anatomic department of the Kazan university, smash educational collections, and everything that remains not split and not trampled, dump in specially prepared coffins, read the burial service and bury under bell-ringing and singing. Middle of the 19th century. The believer caused a new terrible insult: huge bones which, in their opinion, serve as the proof существования the giants described by the Bible,2 science are announced by remains of ancient pangolins. Scientists directly accuse of blasphemy, derogation of the authority of "Scripture" and infringement of "piety bases". End of the 19th century. Now believers are revolted that the gynecology can become legal branch of medicine. The possibility of regard, discussion, studying and image rima pudendi brings them into improbable rage. And only 50 years of the Christian later, sitting in gynecologic chairs, cheerfully wave tickets in the paleontologic and anatomic museums which became fashionable.

Many centuries believers had an opportunity to resolve any issues by means of fires. When took away matches from them, they rushed in legal chasms, demanding protection of special "feelings" special laws. To list everything that throughout twenty centuries caused their hysterics, it is almost impossible. This invention of the railroads, radio, aircraft, well-drilling and explanation of the origin of species. Today we can claim with confidence: everything that once offended religious feelings, became obligatory pride of mankind. But put even not in it. We are disturbed more by the fact that оскорблёthe nnost of believers every time was caused by a certain new reason, and after a while passed without trace. Moreover, thoroughly пооскорблявшись, Christians were very active and grateful users of what caused recently them such "mental anguish". At all desire we do not see any communication of their "feelings" with doctrines of their belief or others couple normal invoices. We see only ordinary human rage which is skillfully directed by their ideologists to one, on another. This rage added in the 8th century a pork snout to Christ on icons, in XVI forced to smash the Russia's first printing house, and in XIX poisoned Darwin. Having got accustomed still пристальнit, we can notice1 intolerance to dissent and innovations. Undoubtedly, the rage and intolerance are strong feelings. But they are not unique and do not grant the rights for privileges. Even this short analysis allows2 to claim that "special feelings" of believers are a fiction. Same far-fetched and artificial concept, as well as belief. The matter is that religiousness is not congenital and inevitable property of the person. DNA is not engaged in such trifles as transfer of confessional accessory. The belief is always result of suggestion, learning or imitation. It is always caused by conditions of the habitat and circumstances. In the same way the situation and with "an insult of feelings" is. If not to learn the believer to be offended, then he never and it will do. Let's consider this statement on very simple example. For the maximum presentation of our mental experiment let's take figure of the main Christian of Russia, adherent of Orthodoxy Vladimir Gundyaev known under a church pseudonym "patriarch Kirill". Let's assume,3 that little Volodya aged two - three years Roma would steal. And, covering up tracks, would resell in other, distant camp. And from there – still further. State borders for Roma a concept conditional. Therefore resales of the curly kid could come to the end in Assam, Bihar or other state of beautiful India. Certainly, brought up by the jungle, Volodya was absolutely other person. He would not know the real name. Its native language would become Bengalese. About any Hristakh, dikirions and kathismas he would not have idea. Slonolitsy Ganesh, multiarmed Kali and a monkey Hanuman would become his gods. Its feelings would never offend prank "Pussy". And from chips of the cross cut Femen our hero would put a kosterchik and cheerfully fried on it a fat festive cobra.

Warm nipple for the red guard
It is necessary to build the second Moscow Kremlin. Existing it is small. He is obviously not able to provide everyone to participate in a licking ceremony Kremlin walls. Even before appearance of red guards of the Surgeon it was close there. Masked Cossacks pushed away orthodox writers. Journalists great power nationalists restricted fiercely the licking gonfaloniers, and warty communists roughly pushed uraanalitik.

Certainly, these actions came true under observation of ensigns, but unpleasant incidents all the same took place. The Black Hundreds deliberately damaged language to Kurginyan, and Limonov supporters by force occupied the lizatelny site of georgiyevets. Now to delicious bricks broke still and red guards. Of course, besides obvious patriotic, this action makes also confidential sense. All participants of process are convinced that they in the ancient walls constructed by Italians are warm the magic nipples capable to supply sucking happiness and material welfare. The main thing – to be climbed to them.1 But all this lyrics. The main thing that in Russia there are red guards now. They are very similar to the Chinese predecessors. Purposes, level of development and mass character. Red guards are what there was so not enough today's Russia to complete the picture. Now country physiognomy finally will get courageous Orochs of line. It is remarkable that red guards appeared then when "the street question" was finally removed. The whining protest of Bolotnaya Square collapsed. There were only singles ready in protest at price increase in public toilets to leave and to urinate silently to themselves in trousers. It is clear, that any punishment is very seductive action. Even with described. But! Head of the shy intellectual, which still dares to be something dissatisfied, as we know, is not dimensionless. It is simply not capable to assume more than seven rubber bludgeons at the same time. And this quantity is quite provided by legions of OMON. Where on the intellectual head will be town still and for a hunveybinsky fist – it is still unclear. Look for, think. But it is a question technical, and it, of course, will be it is solved. Of course, emergence of the wide movement of red guards discredits Russia as the police state. Remains to hope that fights between red guards and police for the right to beat a couple of students after all does not happen. Funny, but all this already once was. What ended with – we know. The Black Hundreds of the 16-17th of years throwing themselves into ecstasies chants about "belief, the tsar and the fatherland", too very much liked to be decorated with tousle, borodishcha and plaques on all trunk. Their courage, of course, was enough for couple of Jewish riots. But generally they were busy beating glasses and beatings of unarmed journalists. In the seventeenth year they ran up, having dressed up as girl students and maids. To new red guards2 it will be more difficult. To them it is necessary to get away, rattling showered from backs rivets. It can give them so the suit of the Tajik painter will be the optimal solution. It is amusing that for that real danger which exists for the present power, any Surgeons not a hindrance. Under one it heel there will be enough place for all motorcyclists of Russia. And she will not even catch their crunch.

Belief with the handle
If the person does not want that laughed at his religion, he can always choose to himself not such ridiculous religion Events on rue Nicolas Appert, 10 very funny reared educated public. Today the European public marches, is indignant, sobs, assigns, wipes, breaks, and also fades in moments of silence. All this bears to Saint Prozaliriya's life a strong resemblance.

This thought, by the way, is not so absurd as it seems at first sight. In case of what.

It is known that the Saint lady did not take off thirty years the monastic dresses. in the afternoon at night. And when for some reason she at last undressed, with horror found in herself breasts, not bad back and other anatomic accessories of obviously sinful mission. St. Prozaliriya could not reconcile to this disgrace which deeply offended it religious feelings, also rushed to a monastic well. It was not succeeded to be drowned by it as the well was narrowish and sacred, certainly, got stuck, without having reached water. Approximately we see the same and today, but already performed by Hollande, Merkel, Cameron's State Duma, and also all multimillion mass meeting grieving on caricaturists from Sharli. All this educated public1 long welcomed various religions, liked to talk about "belief", "spirituality", and also about Christian, Islamic or Buddhist eternal "values" and their value. And suddenly with amazement found out that terrorism is an indispensable and obligatory component of any well warmed "belief". It is unclear, from where there was an illusion of the fact that the religion happens without terrorism? Without attempts to extend the views and ideals by means of blood, fear, rage and coercion? The last two thousand years "belief" only was also engaged in it, covering the world with blood, lighting up it fires and generating hatred of people to each other "on the basis of the relation to this or that deity". Undress any religion – and under sugary covers словес about "love" and "humility" you first of all will find irreconcilable rage to all who dare to think differently, than it is offered "belief". Even we who were not seeing those fires on which Christians alive fried pregnant women nevertheless happened to look at Christian rage in it natural look. Let's remember Breivik, process over Pussyami, riots of exhibitions and irreconcilable rhetoric of the become impudent priests. Open the Bible – and you with own eyes will see the textbook of primitive extremism propagandizing violence, murder, hatred on religious, national, racial and to all other possible signs. By the way, the Bible of the first built murdersTay and disabled people in virtue.2 Still there is a naive confidence that the religion teaches some "good". This illusion can be based only on ignorance or on deliberate ignoring of history of churches, beliefs, faiths and the people. Let's bring the simplest, an axiom which upon cannot be challenged. In Russia the religion undividedly reigned almost 1000. Nobody dared to disturb to bring up it Russians at discretion. It is known that as a result of this education, grown on true "belief", "people-bogonosets" in 1917 threw priests from belltowers, with special pleasure perenasilovat and killed Popovskikh of daughters, and at the same time shot and tore to pieces all whom could reach. Let's remind that any other people, except as baptized, воцерковлёnny, katekhizirovanny and prichashchyonny, in Russia 1917 just was not and could not be. World history is crowded with such global facts. And simple terrorism is in general the everyday tool of any "belief". It it is easy gets from "wide trouser-legs" and very effectively applies it at the first opportunity. Religious terrorism happens local, as in cases to Giordano Bruno, Miguel Servet, towers of the World Trade Center, Gipatiya, Pussyami or to the editorial office "Sharli". And no matter, has or not religious terror a judicial cover. In Pakistan are "judged" the raped girls too before killing them with stones.

In that, or other degree. Those who never read the Bible very much like to argue on exclusive "depth" and "wisdom" of this collection of Hebrew bloody fairy tales and badly imagines what exactly there is written.

There is a terrorism on a more substantial scale when crusades, burning of conservatives, destruction of katar and Cathars, mass suffocations of gyaur, violent baptisms of the whole people, destructions of libraries and civilizations are organized. Muslims, by the way, something become shallow. Quite recently on the same to "a religious sign" they easily cut out the whole cities and the countries. And the formal occasion in the form of any caricatures for this purpose was not required for them. It is necessary to tell that Islam in the gloomy cruelty is not too original. He is only an exemplary pupil of Christianity. Having been born for 600 years later, it efficiently accumulated that experience of "love religion" which had happiness to observe and be influenced personally. Now the insult subject of "feelings of believers" became especially fashionable. What means under these "feelings", absolutely not clearly as existence or lack of religious belief in principle is unprovable. Of course, there is a known evangelical test suggesting to move a look the mountain, to cure imposing of hands of the oncological patient and to snuggle barehanded venomous snakes. In case all three focuses turn out, then the performer has the right to lay claim to the owner of some, very small, of the size of "mustard grain", amounts of "belief". Surprisingly, but all Christians persistently evade from passing of this test. It is quite possible that the most ardent fanatic, istselovavshy взасос thousands of icons, having remained alone with itself, rolls from a laughter, drawing moustaches and horns on a portrait of the famous lady with the baby. Most likely, 99,9% of the blagochestivets testing constant "оскорблёthe nnost of feelings", quite so themselves is also conducted. Today to be so favorable to Orthodox Christians in Russia what to suspect there are no carriers of crosses in sincerity the slightest opportunity. Of course, there are precedents and very strong enthusiasm religious idea. The last history was become by Kouachi's brothers who on the seventh of January visited the editorial office of the satirical magazine "Sharli" locating at the address rue Nicolas Appert, 10. The world of the word, a thought and freedom again closely adjoined to the cave world of "belief". And the cave world gave freedom to the rage again. In the same way as he got used to arrive for 2000 and without any formal occasion. Perhaps, not all drawings "Sharli" were esthetically faultless. But it is absolutely unimportant. Sharli carried out dirty, but great and necessary work, weekly reminding the cave world that it any more not the owner. At least in France. It is important to understand that everything that did Sharli, was not an insult of someone's feelings, and only "protecting fire", the response to continuous attempts of "belief" to take reality, filling it legions of the backs upraised to the sky, pools of mutton blood and religious processions. Sharli were advanced all those who are not obliged and will never "respect" spiteful tales of "belief", 2000 in a row covering Europe with blood and pus. Scratch of felt-tip pens of Sharli, undoubtedly, over time will reach and to Russia. As the majority of samples of domestic culture testifies, everything "purely Russian" is made of very French.

Toilers of the back
Of course, it would be at first sight more correct to characterize deputies as toilers of "the back and a mouth". They have to not only sit, but still and to make sounds. Nevertheless everything indicates that this profession first of all develops not the speech, namely gluteuses, – we see that characteristic exotic gait is inherent in the experienced deputy. Perhaps, it happens because of duration of sessions. And it is possible – and because of excess diligence at implementation of commands: "to sit!" and "to serve!. to the fatherland".

A. G. Nevzorov. "To offend art"

If deputy work was estimated on extent of development of anatomic anomalies, then, certainly, to the State Duma would be what to be proud. But, unfortunately, from it it is required still and certain intellectual product. And here with it the situation is sad. Everything that deputies say or write, alas, does not pull even on the level of a sailor's skit. First, of course, they refreshed the exercises with kind Christian rage, but over time it became boring, and the rage borrowed the the lawful place in a set of spiritual clamps. In Russia there was always in the price also second "clamp", i.e. a skillful and effective holuystvo. Some time the Duma in this sense was out of competition. But estradnik, writers, priests and journalists, using professional skills, outdid poor deputies with their purchased diplomas and tongue-tie. Today you will surprise nobody even with the most heart-breaking vernopoddanichestvo any more. Okhotny Ryad and on this position looks blankly and unconvincingly. This situation causes alarm. We risk to lose the State Duma. She, of course, could sit out quietly, being in the lead only in nonsense and in buttock anomalies, but the next innovation can it to overtake and slam. It is known that in the near future all price tags will contain information, very important for the consumer, in the Russian Federation. Namely: besides final1 the prices in them it will be specified still and actual, production cost of goods. Contrast of figures, undoubtedly, will be stunning. It, of course will upset dealers in pineapples, will grieve builders and will depress producers of condoms. But the present tragedy it will become for deputy corps. So-called "people" at last will have an opportunity to compare the real price of deputy "product" to costs of its production. The cost of beautiful political life of deputies is well-known. Millions are monthly pumped into each elect. And here a product of its activity as it will become clear, тянет it is no more than on "two-room flat".2 It is easy to establish the original price of deputy exercises by means of standard quotations on services of animators, inventors on office parties and other "rechevik". They are well-known and, as a rule, do not exceed 300–500 rubles. Of course, literally of this word nobody will fasten price tags on elects. For this purpose there are subsignets, "running lines" and other technical tricks. Possibly, it would be expedient that each deputy, sweating and shivering, before scoring of the next initiative, itself would remind in what sum it is already managed to the country – including its own salary and salaries of his assistants, the maintenance of the device serving it and buildings creating its comfort. Here it will also become clear that poor Russia overpays for doubtful services of the State Duma in hundreds and thousands of times. Of course, marasmus has the charm, but its prime cost nevertheless is much lower. Certainly, the Duma should be helped out. Perhaps, deputies have hidden talents? Their existence, of course, will not resolve an issue considerably, but though slightly will reduce a dreadful gap between the cost of their contents and the actual price of their "product". Perhaps, someone from them is capable, for example, to a bioluminescence? It could be checked, having held several plenary sessions in complete darkness. With broadcasting, certainly, over all channels.

Most likely, it is difficult, but fascinating process. We hear how the population of the Russian Federation champs news more and more loudly, penetrating into the mysteries of war and peace. It so was fond of tasting that it absolutely forgot about the initial task. That is about the attempt nevertheless to learn a parmesan grade. Viewing of news in the Russian Federation turned into a civil ceremony, became the major part cave черносотенного a cult. Пережёinformation vannost, it obrabotannost acids and gastric juice of ideology, it wandering on twisting intestines of media do not play any role any more. The product perfectly is used and enjoys wide popularity. Besides mass media Russia learned to fill it with gases of true spirituality. It gives to the product yield moment to the consumer characteristic, easily recognizable sonority. In this metaphor there is neither dramatization, nor a stretch. Production media of a product also cannot be other, than it is registered in "a thirdI eat the law" professor Hitler.1 The third law says: "Any promotion has to be available to weight: it level has to proceed from the measure of understanding peculiar to the most backward individuals from among those whom it wants to influence. Than promotion addresses the bigger number of people, has to be that more elementary it ideological level".2 All media around the world3 follow this law. Especially in hard times. If the rating of news is incredibly high, then it means that "the dullness bottom" is already reached. The public adores unambiguity. Especially Russian. She is able to be grateful to the one who saves it from nasty need to think. About 88%, and this figure all are already saved grows. Virtual cave черносотенный the world was for them very cozy town. In all this there is no tragedy and any infringement of the personality. If the outlook of the person is created by the TV, it means that never it also had it. Of course, all this prevents the population to realize reality, but it interests the people approximately the same as taste of parmesan. That is in general in any way. Moreover, reality by the most nature piece Russophobic and antistate. The place in Russia should not be it also, and intolerance to it has to become obligatory line of the true patriot. Confuses only the fact that still not everywhere and not in everything the victory is won over it. For example, in a question of absolute originality and uniqueness "Russian mira", "the Russian civilization" no, and the nasty snout of reality capable to spoil all beauty of a patriotic picture will seem. The cave call competing in popularity with Krymnash "Russia not Europe!" sounds not so beautifully as could. And all because reality so far still dares to remind of himself.4 It is known that the ideology of "an original and unique Russian civilization" has small problem. Something "Russian"5 to find in public landscapes it is almost unreal. Everything from what modern life of the Russian Federation is weaved, has strictly western origin. And any another. Again also everything is borrowed, without exception. Including, by the way, and culture. Both Eugene Onegin, and "Anna Karenina" – products "license", made on those western literary technologies which Europe developed several centuries.

Russia had no idea even of existence of rhymes. Europe perfected forms of poems, novels and symphonies, it set their stylistics and design. So it is no more "Russian" in Eugene Onegin, than in "Ford-Fokaсе", collected in Vsevolozhsk.1 On the European technologies also all the rest was created. Let's remind that even the Kremlin and its cathedrals are built by Italians. And national symbol"nested doll" is even not Europe, and simple plagiarism from the Japanese toy of the tolstenky god Fukurokodzyu who had a set of entities which could be taken the friend from the friend. Not better the situation and with spirituality is. In the main product of media it contents, of course, is very high. But in reality the orthodox idea is bloodless and goes bad. Partly it happens for quite objective reasons, partly because of the Ukrainian puncture of Gundyaev. Three years Gundyaev hit himself with fists into a dusty breast, enchanting the Kremlin himself about improbable adgeziruyushchy properties of Orthodoxy capable to so stick together between himself the people that no "global backstage" will manage to tear this communication. He guaranteed that "the spiritual component" will keep Ukraine in full submission and humility to Moscow. For success of operation it was required very little: to enter a powerful religious component into "the Ukrainian plan", to make heels of pious heroes, and also to transfer ROC couple of thousands of real estate objects. The Kremlin which is not shining with special intelligence easily it was moved – also held up ears under noodles, having made in the Ukrainian game a big rate on orthodox superglue. The religious component was well warmed and deeply "entered" to public. The real estate was transferred. "Dusty" personally spent month for reading spells and as a result bewitched three the sad military personnel of toads in"Old Russian heroes" which were immediately thrown in a game. The result as we know, turned out very impressive. Orthodox fanatics – for the sake of Orthodoxy and unity "the Russian mira" – began to kill tiresomely and ineptly orthodox soldiers of orthodox Ukraine, hiding from their Orthodox Christians mortars behind backs of orthodox dealers in a gooseberry and same Orthodox Christians miner's daughters. As a result of such improbable concentration of Orthodoxy and spirituality several thousands of people senselessly died, the southeast of Ukraine was crushed and plundered, and Russia is dishonored. Game collapsed as the situation got all signs of dirty and is unique senseless scandal. There is no doubt that on degree it is aimlessst and uselessness to anybody in general2 the town in the Guinness Book of Records is provided to "the Donbass scandal". "Just princes of Novorossiya" suddenly became covered by warts, again turned into the Moscow toads and uprygat to the country of full-time residence. In other words, the orthodox factor did not work exactly for 100%. At the end of May extremely unpleasant conversation after which "Dusty" was removed from the Kremlin took place, sobbing and covering a big shiner. If "Krymnash" at least allowed the Russian Federation to rear for a while three hairs which remained from great-power wool, then "Novorossiya project" was chemically pure marasmus which does not have in general any explanation, any purpose and any distinct compounding of its end. The public, by the way, began to yawn and switch obviously. It is a signal that in the nearest future Russia it is necessary to try a new ideological dish. Its taste will be, of course, slightly other, but very familiar.

Looking in a penis
There is no doubt that the deputy of the State Duma who is publicly saying especially rich nonsense feels the acute pleasure. Probably, same as exhibitionist which managed to show the gray genitals to big crowd of pensioners, children and mummies. The deputy has, of course, an audience more, than at the pervert in a public garden, but probably and the satisfaction is more feasible. In general exhibitionism now in fashion. Besides deputies to them also ministers play about. In total, of course surpassed Rogozin who proved to be to the press of "all" in a uniform. Medinsky timidly showed to the country wrung out at Italian унивersiteta cloak. The smile1 he was obviously obliged to that to "an excess chromosome" about which the minister likes to mention as the special benefit. The Izborsky club made the decision to hold meetings of "saviors of Russia" only in kokoshniks. We will be fair: the most part of the Black Hundreds they very much go, refreshing with shine of pearls their global physiognomies. Heads of the Duma fractions, officials and bottoms openly show the true worth in the TV. Of course, it is not quite usual exhibitionism. But it is the voluptuous and triumphing demonstration too what should be hidden carefully from all, except the doctor and sexual partner. The public exposure of the most shameful and stupid becomes the best manifestation in Russia reliability. And a unification symbol with a state machinery. Exception is only Apollo on hundred-ruble to the note. His small penis which recently damaged mind of the Duma and the most part of spiritual clamps of Russia will be, most likely it is forbidden. Already now the church recommends to nuns, parishioners, virgins, and in particular pious loose women at recalculation it is earnedny notes to use mittens.2 Certainly, new revolution in Russia is necessary. And not so much for change of the power, how many for change of the people. Only in power to change revolution human weight and to return it from chauvinistic dreams in reality. Revolution3 works not really esthetically, but it is productive. And degree of morbidity with which it hirurgirut society directly depends on the level of inadequacy of the last. In this sense today Russia out of competition. Heated "just rage" for the whole world, chosen isolation and denseness, inspired chernosotenstvo and dushitelsky ambitions, she, of course, is patient No. 1. It was noticed even by the weak-sighted Kremlin. Also took measures. Отгрызть at the future revolution of a hand entrusted an animal of "the imperial idea". But brought out of surkovsky cellars on public, the animal appeared шелудив, is ugly thin and weak. The attempt to feed up an animal "krymnashy" and meat of young Ukrainians of forces to it did not add. And only led the poor fellow to diarrhea, and so powerful that splashes scattered worldwide. Their Kremlin got most of all. As a result the invention was not just foolish, but also extremely fetid. Now it is necessary somehow отстto iryvat the top officials of the state.4 And as to make it, nobody knows. Various it is watered technological drizzles about it, of course are present. The idea of the dear Kurginyan who suggested to make a stench norm is in the lead, and to forbid usual air in all territory of the Russian Federation. Certainly, Russia which is brought up in disgust for any revolution itthat is called "does not want". But it nobody asks. Revolution is not accustomed to be interested at all in opinion of the

country which it intends "to visit". If the country does not want to develop, does not want to adapt good to the changed world, then revolution will force it to make it through pain and chaos. Military patriotic rhetoric, hysterics of tsars and a spell of priests are absolutely indifferent for it. Evolution was not counted too with desires of pangolins which for certain would like to keep forever the huge sizes, the number of teeth and won "blood of grandfathers" status. But evolution is ruthless. The Mesozoic comes to an end – the status comes to an end. Changes are inevitable. Russia, apparently, did not understand yet that it native "Mesozoic" ended and it is necessary to change cardinally. In a modern landscape dinosaurs are not really pertinent. Of course, it is hard, especially when the national idea still hysterically dictates "to kill, blow up, reel up guts on caterpillars, to bring down, flog, trample and to put". But "not just like that", and for the sake of a celebration of spirituality, preservation of territorial formidability and some there "special way".1 So far Russia follows the dinozavrsky ideal, the world and will have to it no feelings, except loathing and desire to be quit one way or another. The new national idea which following radically would help the country not only to change, but also to give it original greatness is necessary. In this idea there has to be so much energy, impudences, beauty and forces that one aspiration to it would already change statehood and forever would cross out kishkonamatyvatelny nonsense about "Russian mire". The beautiful national ideas roll under legs, but they cannot be noticed. They are boring as in them there is no place "to trample, reel up, forbid, to put". "Stupid", according to some satirist, America is the country of 360 Nobel Prize laureates. The "corrupted" Europe generated 364 winners. And Great Russia2 gave them to the world … only 23. Comparison of these figures, alas, contains reflection of a real contribution of the nation to a civilization and development of the person. Ratio, of course, shameful. It is clear, that for Russia to catch up and overtake even "stupid" America on number of Nobel laureates unrealistic. Though for this breakthrough at Russia always was and there is everything. But she is very busy. She reels up someone's guts on caterpillars again, licks hands to bottoms, and furtively examines well-known hundred ruble bank note.

The most disgusting in work of the president – it is necessarySt3 it is constant to entertain more than hundred million idiots. The matter is that without amusements staged by the power, the population actively invents own entertainments: riots, strikes, mass robberies and meetings. It is inclined to amuse international4 slaughter, and also creation of gangs, undergrounds and sects. It is impossible to tell that the public in the Russian Federation is bad or very whimsical. No. It is not worse than public5 ancient Roman circuses. To it nravitся to observe merrymakings with weapon.6 She claps to faces of various political elephants on the arena.

And she is able to adore honestly those emperors that do not stint representations. Others words, public as public.1 These circumstances, of course, doom the first person still and for a role of the animator inventor. But the choice of national show programs, alas, is small today. Space is lost. Пopa bothered. And elephants are interrupted.2 In such situation remains only anew to scroll the archaic show called "Great Russia". It turned out that this old project perfectly works. All are keen, all are cheerful, all at business. The public delighted waves tags and tapes of different degree of a polosatost. It still confuses "krymnash" and "отченаш", but it it does not sadden happiness. Rogozin builds the confidential plants on the Moon. The Black Hundreds in a confidential shed of Izborsk try to get the main symbol of Orthodoxy. They believe that it will recover, zatarakhtit and will spread to reel up guts of the spiritless planet on sacred caterpillars. And they submissively will follow it and butts will smooth out sinful space of the West under "Russian mir", having hammered into the heads incidentally escaped pearls about "a teardrop child" and kind "people-bogonostse". To provide a pomposity of this messianic procession, the Black Hundreds took advantage of the opportunity and revived an imperial flag. It is remarkable that instead of an eagle on him will be placed crossed out lacy pants, that, of course, will be the best symbol of the country of the won spirituality. The Black Hundreds are surprisingly naive. All elements of a show are taken in all good faith. They sacredly believe that they have "mission" that the Kremlin entrusted them reconstruction of the national idea. The Kremlin grins and irons them grants on foolishes to tops. In other words, everything turned out in the best way. It is curious that construction of imperial scenery cost to the Kremlin cheaper, than an asfaltization of roads in the region of the average sizes. But we know that asphalt the whimsical Russian public cannot be entertained in general. And here attractions "Great Russia", "Krymnash" and "Rogozin on the Moon" make enormous success. Only problem3: shows such quickly get out of hand. Its ordinary participants in a patriotic fuse lose orientation and the podbitiya of "Boeings", excess tortures in cellars of Luhansk bring in the scenario a gag it seems or directly begin to shake the tattooed fists to the director- to the director. The situation degree unpleasantly changes. What was planned as innocent reconstruction of terrorism quickly changes in terrorism real. The show breaks from a lead. It not only saddens the events, but also begins with unpleasant persistence to show to the Kremlin the road there where it in general did not gather. That is simply in a military and apocalyptic anus which sizes and the soaking-up power are quite comparable to OJ 287 or others "black holes" of the Universe.

From all possible maneuvers in this situation remains only one. Brilliantly beautiful, sudden for all, purely Napoleonic bend capable to seat in pools and the East, and the West to reconcile Russia and Ukraine – and to stop up to chyortov hole. Introduction of troops of the Russian Federation on the territory of Ukraine means. But! Only for sincere and brotherly association with the Ukrainian anti-terrorist operation forces. And only for a joint udavleniye of war. Alas, in the person of those who it represents and kindles. Without paying attention to such trifles as dreams, the ideas, slogans, views, belief and even personal charm. It is already too close povanivayushchy the general death"black hole". Any more not to such trifles, as book dreams moustached re-enactors. Of course, it is a pity for romantics terrorists. But they can compensate loss of life by "installation of a bust in the homeland of the hero". Over time. In about fifty years. When another show demands replenishment of a national pantheon.

In claws of a pigopagus
Let's begin from far away. Let's get accustomed to the State Emblem of the Russian Federation. On it – two-headed eagle. Any distinct explanations why Russia is symbolized by this being, neither heraldic officers, nor historians can offer. Both those, and others roll up eyes, then make assignment of a lower lip on top and begin muffled, but pathos бубнёabout shumer, Byzantium and the Golden Horde, which such eagle too in the time used. Popolzovannost of a bird the dear shumer and ordynets, of course gives to symbol the weight and authoritativeness, but does not answer a simple question in any way: and what it, actually, designates?1 Possibly, this image contains some sense indicating secret essence of the Russian state? As we know, in heraldry nothing "just like that" happens. Placed in the stamp field of a being and objects always testify to a certain important feature of a gerboobladatel. For example, ten chamber-pots are placed with Orinali's family in the coat of arms. At Kolleoni – torn off testiclesы, and at D'Amfrevily – toadstools.2 We are verified with the facts and we are convinced that pots, toadstools and eggs are only fixing of the fact that ten generations of Orinali had diarrhea, the devout founder of a sort ate with D'Amfrevilya only toadstools, and Kolleoni lost testicles owing to blow spear on a tournament. As we see, the heraldry is exact and historical. Possibly, and the two-headed bird of Russia has too the explanation, besides foggy mythemes and imaginations of historians. Perhaps, for interpretation of a national symbol it is necessary to address disciplines, just and explaining various anomalies? For example, to a teratologiya – science about the reasons and mechanisms of embryonic ugliness.

Considering exclusive sensitivity of a subject, we will specify that the Big medical encyclopedia, and also specialized works on a teratologiya do not appear in the list extremist or forbidden in Russia of materials. Therefore, and those interpretations of a dvuglavost which can offer these works cannot be referred to offensive or offensive for state symbolics in any way. And so, according to all teratologichesky works, in the Russian coat of arms it is represented пигопагус.1 Let's specify. Pigopagiya is a so-called twinning, two-headed ugliness at which organisms, owing to a mutation, in a maternal womb grow together certain areas and completely lose any viability. It is the heaviest anomaly of development which dooms a mutant after the delivery to extremely short, painful existence. Most often m pigopagusaёrtvorozhdenna, but in rare instances it released several minutes of life. In such situation unceasing spasms, aggression and uncontrolled releases of physiological liquids are characteristic of pigopagus. However, to investigatefir-trees note that tenacity of paws2 two-headed mutant in many respects exceeds standard. Laboratory assistants and taxidermists who happened to work with similar copies, demonstrate that improbable tenacity of paws and claws remains even at the alcoholized or taksidermirovanny medicines. In other words, pigopagusa do not unclench claws. And even after death never release what got to them. Only "career" for such being is a bank in cabinet of curiosities or an effigy. In other words, it is necessary to recognize that Russia chose the symbol a rare and peculiar being. Possibly, deadborn mutant in the coat of arms and on banners contains hint on certain, unknown to us, but very important state secret. And it, as we know, is protected by the law. Here we have a need to softly change the subject and very tactfully to pass to authorship of the Russian national idea of "the Third Rome", "the Russian mira" and "A special way". There is a stereotype that all these ideologems "are shrouded in Old Russian fogs". It not absolutely so. Russian the old times about them did not know.3 Dreams of "the Third Rome" were exaggerated still the Bulgarians seeing the Tyrnovo "New Constantinople". Later they were a favourite ideological toy of Benito Mussolini. So in the concept of "the Third Rome" there is nothing neither Russian, nor original. The Slavophile idea of "A special Russian way" which is considered blood Russian has very curious origin too. It is "seamless".4 Её original authors – Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, the German storytellers of the 19th century. Those brothers Grimm. It is not a joke and not a joke. It is the fact. The matter is that Slavophilism – in essence, a simple tracing-paper from the western theories of "romantic nationalism".
And it is possible, торакопагус. But more likely nevertheless пигопагус. Andwhether fingers. 3 ЕSlee not to consider especial backscratching of the monk Filofey who in some pisula liked to compare the tsar Vasily III to lords of Byzantium. 4 T. e. entirely and without changes of borrowed.

In the 1765th "the gloomy German genius" Karl von Mozer's feather otmakhat the treatise "About the German National Spirit". The treatise, because of clumsiness of writing, did not become the best-seller, but nevertheless attracted attention. A bit later stated in Nёm of the idea were skillfully processed by brothers storytellers. In "grimmovsky" interpretation "the romantic nationalism" of year three pobudorazhit Europe, and then was safely forgotten. Several years the idea became dusty without any application, so far on it early Slavophiles did not come across. They admired, picked up it, plagiatirovat and1 without references to "any there storytellers" dragged on "the Russian soil". Here it thoroughly impregnated with pathos, blood of generations and a smell an onucha. Decorated with crosses, "spirituality" and "feeling of the enemy around". State car of that time with satisfaction gave a starting signal – and creation of brothers Grimm became fundamentals of national ideology of Russia. Until Russians also did not suspect that they some "special" and that their world mission consists in mass mutually destruction for the sake of ideals of different degree of a peshchernost. Some time of the idea of "a special way" kept silence and seemed rested long ago. But today we have a rare opportunity to look at how, breaking off shrouds and pelenalny bandage, they throw back covers of the sarcophagi and again take space. Nichy surprising. When2 there is neither present, nor the future, the past sets in.

Iron bast shoes of the Kremlin
Patriotism, unlike other hallucinogens, forms the steady confidential relations with the visions arising under its influence Patriotic visions are hysterical, aggressive and persistent. They have the opinion on length of ladies' skirts and styles of spiritual clamps. They can give the command to conquer the Moon or "to attach" the lake Chad, having lifted on it a mutiny of hippopotamuses. Task of the skilled patriot – not only to execute such order, but also to broadcast heard to that masses which it is insufficiently good "hear the homeland", stretched from Zimbabwe to Kuriles. It is necessary to remember that, besides tasks applied and intermediate, patriotism always has a main goal. That for the sake of which this ideological drug is also pumped to the country in veins. It consists in that on the first click of fingers of any fool in stripes of crowd of boys voluntarily would agree to turn into the decaying burned meat. In that before the next senseless slaughter anybody of them would even have no question: "And for what devil?» Patriotism excellently copes also with the second task – to maintain up to standard that property of citizens of the Russian Federation which distinguishes them radically from corrupted Europeans. The Russian is born, lives also dies with radical confidence that the state has the full and inalienable right to ruin it, to spoil, kill and force to bow to any idol.

If not this "sanctity of the power" hammered into each head, then in the 37th companions in leather jackets would be met by a pitchfork everywhere and fire shot-guns, but not shameful humility. It it1 drove millions in the camp and sepulchral ditches. Nkvdshniki and screws only served this main national property – voluntary recognition of absolute power of an iron bast shoe of the Kremlin. Today the silly population not always understands why it has to endow children and life for the sake of blueness of ministerial pools on Majorca. still it is more difficult to explain to the citizen that its real destination – not life and happiness, but comfort of talkative dependents with purchased diplomas which on Okhotny Ryad ventriloquize on behalf of Russia. Certainly, the comfort of priests and deputies should think up a terrible sacral pseudonym. If everything is cynical to call by the names, then crawling with the released guts can not deliver to the citizen of that moral satisfaction which, perhaps, heroes of the last wars had. Such pseudonym is: this magic word "homeland". And the accurate ogovorochka is surely applied to it that "the homeland is one, and the state is another". But "homeland" in that case is absolutely abstract concept with which in reality it is impossible to be crossed. Actually between the concepts "homeland" and "state" there is no tangible line. It is the old checked trick. As a fine illustration of its efficiency serve bottoms. They urge to subsidize their abstract god, but offered at once turn into an ikorka and "Lexuses". By the same principle also "homeland" is thought up. Object of love and awe the country not real, full of nightmares, and a certain abstract Russia appears. Nobody ever lived in it. it nobody ever saw. But to it – invisible, intangible and fine, it is necessary to sacrifice himself on the first whistle of the official who saw enough patriotic hallucinations. But there is an embarrassment which is swept especially well up today. Look narrowly. When you caress abstract Russia, the erection arises at "Uniform".

Lie as genre
"Sunstroke" of Mikhalkov and series "Rasputin" on the First: new Russian cinema on birch bark As both creations according to the status are obvious not "Pirates of the Caribbean Sea", there is no sense to estimate their cinema advantages or shortcomings. Today "artistry" begins with absolutely other figures of the budget. It is senseless and incorrect to discuss "Blow" or Rasputin as "big cinema". Kinoyazyk in them exactly such what was allowed by financial opportunities of these two amazingly similar pictures. They were done by skilled masters, perfectly knowinglyе what to genialnichat on copper2 money it does not make any sense. Everything is modest and standard. Actors inexpensive, but diligent, and set of production receptions long ago known, but mainly very simple. In this sense to speak in general not about what. However, both director on as did not apply, and honestly stuck together "expanded propaganda materials" which have no tasks, except strictly ideological.

Therefore, the offered idea, and also ability to screw in properly can only be the only subject of assessment it in consciousness of masses. The idea is that Russia should think up and draw the beautiful past backdating. It is a complex challenge as the upclassing of the Russian history is possible only through substitution it pure lie. The word "lie" it is not necessary to be frightened. Also it is not necessary to roll up eyes sanctimonious; all culture of homo almost for 100% consists of a pure lie or it main components. Of course, it is a difficult genre, but historical lie today especially it is demanded also it is necessary. The matter is that it is the main construction material for any ideology, creating today's realities the juicy and authoritative past. Without it an unnecessary impression can be made that "Russian mir" is only bindyuzhnik with machine guns, the warped Dugin, dullness of the Duma and production saliva of Kurginyan. Ideology, despite peep of liberals, surely it is created also takes root. It first of all also needs a high-quality lie in tovarnax quantities.1 Let's return in a subject. Today the Russian cinema has a priority: contrary to all facts to create illusion of existence absolutely separate "Russian mira", or "the Russian civilization". It is difficult, but in principle it is possible when "the most important of arts" undertakes for good reason responsibly and with a spark. The real Russian cinema, of course, should be done on birch bark. Then a proud call to Europe and the declaration of existence of the special "Russian civilization" will look not so funny. But we will forgive to creators of pictures a sin of use of the European forms, receptions and technologies. This sin to very few people is swept up today. The public is already so well aligned by air hammers that lost touch with reality and "self-sufficient Russian mira" already believed in existence. This thought-up world it is necessary to occupy heroes. For roles of heroes the discussed film cloths offered пravoslavny court faun2 and the eregirovanny officer who long catches a kerchief. With Rasputin, of course, there was a discrepancy. The poor fellow was castrated, and his image went out at once. On a root the main and only intrigue is killed: whether it managed to Grigory Efimovich to lift up the Main Skirt of the Country or he was not in time? The matter is that only dramatic art, concluded in the name "Rasputin", is a juicy conflict of a wild rural penis and the scented court vaginas. It is known still from Molière eternal motive of use of "the God's word" for penetration under the most expensive skirts. Rasputin's use in any other quality is as unnatural as attempt to make not a collar, but a chop of a polecat. Having sequestered Rasputina that body which, actually, also moved it, creators of the movie received a figure of the ploskonky sad obscurantist for whom at cinema "about Rasputin" there are no place and occupation. The movie can be not watched to the end. It is clear, that in Grigory Efimovich's final will admit to United Russia and will suggest to teach in MSU. To other hero of the original Russian world the penis was left after all, but to it it did not add either expressiveness, or dramaturgic mobility. Bunin is taken as a basis of patriotic illusion of Mikhalkov. It is a right choice. Ivan to Alyaксеевич – a model water measure,3 sliding to and fro on a smooth surface of a twig and absolutely not anxious with the processes happening in its depth. When the decayed twig is pumped out at last, the water measure, respectively, is indignant. Also perishes. This fundamental principle is extraordinary convenient because it on legal grounds allows not to have the slightest concept about what actually was Russia overturned in the seventeenth year.

It is worth to remember that the lie has also one more, extremely important state-building role: it is a traditional spiritual clamp of Russia, not less important, than, for example, a holuystvo, rage, obscurantism or theft. 2 G.E.Rasputina. 3 Gerris lacustris.

And it was the country where for reading article in a student's krear sentenced to execution.1 Where the highest police rank directly in the middle of the capital of the empire could easily and with pleasure publicly to beat political prisoner.2 Where romantic potrakhivaniye of officers for some reason had to provide financially millions of zavshivlenny illiterate people living on earth floors and carrying on Nwinding oga from wood bark.3 Where it was by order offered to the real officers attending balls "not to blow nose on floors" and "for commission of big need not to get out on mansion balconies, and otpravlitься for this purpose to latrines".4 Where the power without hesitation, on the first whim killed millions of citizens. As we remember, an orthodox pastriotichesky psychosis of Nicholas II,5 entangled the country in senseless and nothing World War I threatening to Russia, managed in 18 000 000 liters6 the soldier's blood which is splashed out on a history garbage can and in 240 000 tons of the Russian soldier's meat which decayed in the same place. The purpose of all this religious and meat epic and remained known to nobody. What is "great Russia", already clear. It seems, for this poor country "great shocks" were nevertheless smaller disaster. Though on all this in "Blow", certainly, is not present even hint, and Charles Darwin appears the main revolutionary, the mikhalkovsky picture nevertheless is insufficiently sugary. For effective ideological material in it a little real, high-quality lie. As, however, and in Rasputin. Certainly, the cause is not a kramolnichanye directors. Their elongation in фрунт and readiness to serve ideology in the best way do not raise the slightest doubts. Possibly, they were brought nevertheless by need to use techniques, receptions and technologies of the corrupted European cinema. These devil's tricks, worked Zeffirelli, Verbinsky and Peter Jackson, introduce absolutely unnecessary nuances, create graphic and semantic hindrances. However, with conversion of the Russian film production to birch bark and Church Slavonic language this question, undoubtedly, will be it is solved, and the viewer will receive ideologically full-fledged product.

Chemically true cynicism
The most convincing form of a lie are monuments – in them lies about the person or the phenomenon concentrates. The monument representing "Pavlov's dog" is touching. But it could be still it is more touching if near a doggie also bronze was placed child. The matter is that Ivan Petrovich Pavlov's school made vivisektorsky experiments not only over doggies, but also over people. As laboratory material homeless children at the age of 6–15 years were used. It were rigid experiments, but they allowed to understand the nature of thinking of the person. These experiences were put in children's clinic of the 1st LMI, in Filatovsky hospital, in hospital of Raukhfus, in department of experimental pediatrics of IEMA, and also in several orphanages. Surnames of the homeless children and orphans who became laboratory material probably are not essential information. In two works N. I. Krasnogorsky "Development of the doctrine about

физиологическoh activity of a brain at children"1 and "Higher nervous activity child»2 they are marked as "L. M.", "K. M.", "K. E.", "F. E." or as Klava O., V.'s Musya, Yura K., et cetera. Professor Mayorov who was the official chronicler of the Pavlovsk school melancholically noted: "Some of our employees expanded a circle of experimental objects and were engaged in studying of conditioned reflexes at other animal species; at fishes, astsidiya, birds, the lowest monkeys, and also children".3 Let's note that so-called "moral" assessment of these experiments does not enter problems of our research. We consider only the received result and its meanings. Does not influence the value of a good artifact in any way by whom exactly it was got – the archeologist or the robber of graves. And we – consider exclusively artifact. We are interested only its value, but not what circumstances accompanied a find. Certainly, absolutely to hide from criminal smack of the Pavlovsk vivisections it will not turn out. The factor of suffering of children, undoubtedly, was present. But it was partly it is softened the fact that all experimental were orphans. And the most suffering party in all dreadful situations with children, as we know, are their parents. Also we will note that blood of little homeless children was shed not for nothing. The sacral question tormenting philosophers with times Aristotle, it appeared it is solved for few years of vivisections. So, that really happened in laboratories of the Pavlovsk school in the first third of last century? As we remember, Ivan Petrovich already dealt with digestion physiology, for as got the Nobel Prize. The triumph convinced him that "key" of a system experiment, with same ease, as the stomach, can "open" also a brain. Descartes, Lametri and Sechenov bequeathed to him confidence that the mystery of thinking has to have a simple physiological solution. It appeared really so: Pavlov easily found it in formation of conditioned reflexes at dogs. However it was only vague knowledge. It was necessary to prove that the principles of the reflektorika weaving reason are valid also for a brain of the person. But! It was possible to make it only in the way experiment. Certainly, having applied the same techniques to experimental people that are applied to rats, cats and dogs. A large amount of various laboratory material was an indispensable condition. The task could become unsoluble, but pavlovets were helped out by an originality of post-revolutionary time. Commissioners sat down in a deep curtsey and provided pavlovets to all necessary. I will remind that vivisections during an era of crude, primitive Leninism when the power of Councils began still with might and main coquetted with Ivan Petrovich. And "laboratory materialy" groups of pupils of Pavlov4 there were street children. The complete understanding in all instances was provided by ChK. Undoubtedly, a part of experimental was exposed to rigid to hirurgirovaniye. As an anesthesia morphine, sulfate magnesium, and sometimes alcohol was used. The channel of salivary gland was brought out of a mouth outside, by the "dog" principle. The author has no personal experience of carrying out such experiments on human material. But there are no reasons to believe that their equipment differs from work with any other mammal. I will remind, that anatomic distinctions of a mouth5 dog and the person are insignificant.

Removal operation "stenonov of a channel" in itself is not difficult, but is painful and long. Cheeks, certainly, are spoiled on for the rest of the life. Even at doggies. Let's explain specifics of a hirurgirovaniye. That channel via which saliva from parotid gland gets into a mouth should be moved outside, on a cheek. And it is not simple to move, but also properly to replant there to control all expirations. Pavlovtsa did it so: "Sick K.H. was admitted 11 years to children's clinic of 1 Medical institute <…> We attached a fistula circle mendeleevsky putty a small funnel by means of which saliva at the operated animals usually gathers, and had an opportunity to quantitatively measure secretion of salivary gland at this patient. At first we easily developed a natural conditioned reflex, showing to the child various feedstuffs …".1 Operation alternative – the iron slyunosbornik of Leshli fastening in a mouth with "prisosy". Piece uncontrollable and extremely painful. A. A. Yushchenko in work "Conditioned reflexes child»2 rather frankly describes: "At one from children for whom I worked,3 after an hourly experiment from a prisos there was a bloody ring demanding for total disappearance of 1-2 days <…> The trauma even after hourly experience was so considerable that sometimes forces to experiment not more often as every other day, even two". Undoubtedly, it is thousandfold the rehearsed "dog conclusion" was more convenient for pavlovets. Secretion of parotid salivary gland of little homeless children was excited by a cranberry, chocolate, cabbage cabbage stumps, bread and cabbage leaves. And the food reinforcement moved via the beautiful chromeplated devices. They, by the way, caused surprising awe of commissioners and were protected with special eagerness. "Kololka" and current were periodically applied. All this is confirmed by protocols, photos and documentary фильmegohm of "Mechanic of a brain".4 In the the first work Krasnogorsk noted that "experiences with food reflexes are in most cases very popular among children; doctors often should hear: take me in laboratory is a cranberry etc.". This popularity is easily explainable. Diets of shelters were extremely poor, and orphans – are hungry. And here commissioners grew white for anger, watching how they to "punks" feed chocolate and cabbage stumps. They boiled under budyonovka, but kept mum. However, sometimes pavlovets touched with painful influence. Consequences of such "search" by a gentle professorial feather were recorded by Ivanov-Smolensk: "Attempts to flight, in particular after acquaintance with a defensive "electroskin reinforcement" were observed". If business went too far, commissioners were connected – and order was restored. Fugitives were caught, returned, pacified and sent back to laboratories. Certainly, orphans did not understand that holes in their cheeks crown a long story of comprehension of the principles of work of a brain. As a result pavlovets managed to prove that any basic difference between slozhnonervny activity of animals and the person without existingt. Mechanism of a conditioned reflex5 it is identical.

Cabbage stumps erased from process of thinking last "gilding" of mysticism and not cognoscibility. It became finally clear that unique properties which would distinguish a brain of the person from a brain of an animal do not exist. The theory of conditioned reflexes stopped being "about doggies" and became "about the person". Relevancy of this opening is undoubted, and uncertainty is paradoxical. Work of the Pavlovsk school was ignored by the world though contained faultlessly dockzatelny and so longawaited1 explanations of the principles of work of a brain. It has several reasons. The first consists in absolute impossibility to legalize proofs of opening. They, certainly, are, but it is impossible to show them. The matter is that to the middle of the century representations about admissible were dramatized when carrying out an experiment. On a neck of science the ethics loop dragged on. Moralists took all "heights" and sharply limited researches by means of a set of Ethical Codes. At all scientific organizations "ethical councils" were created. Magazines were deprived of the rights for publications about experiments at which were broken трebovaniye of ethical declarations.2 In this situation bloody experiences over orphans could be regarded only as a crime. Even simple presentation of their protocols could end with tribunal. However, to a condensation of ethical clouds attempts to legalize opening nevertheless were made. In 1929 Ivan Petrovich was nominated for the second Nobel Prize. Its candidate was wrapped still at a consideration stage, having recommended more to anybody to show developments with homeless children as "the fact discrediting science", "unsociableness" and "chemically true cynicism to which should not fall scientist». The most important opening of the XX century was buried and buried in dark oblivion. It is not accepted even to mention it. Researchers of a brain were in the idiotic position. Today they remind astronomers who heard nothing about Galilei's opening and continue to believe in crystal ptolemeevsky spheres. However, oblivion had also the second reason. Having trained on the evolutionary theory, people learned to ignore masterly everything that contradicts cultural and historical dogmas and tales of exclusiveness of homo. And the sense of opening of the Pavlovsk school appeared still more offensive, than Darwinism. Results of experiments involuntarily wrote off in junk of "platonov-edgings-gegeley" and other exercises about "a sacrament of human thinking". There "conscience", "belief", "morals" and other push-apa were sent. Some poet declared: "Darkness of the low truth the ennobling deception is more expensive us than us". In translation it means that pleasure own nonsense – very strong feeling. And not only at poets. It at the heart of in general all culture of homo which extremely painfully reacts to attempt to finish with "deception". Of course, for the last three centuries revision of "eternal values" partly came true. It became clear that "Thou shalt not kill" and "do not steal a precept", undoubtedly, are lovely, but deprive of us important life experience. Our ancestors were significantly below us on the level of development. They willingly perished for the homeland or belief. There were fair suspicions that two of these factors are

Withabout Descartes's times. There was a final formalization of the bans embodied in decisions of the Third General Assembly of the World medical association a bit later (London, 1949), and in the 1968th and 1983rd, on the General Assemblies in Sydney and Venice, the list of unlawful was considerably expanded.

somehow connected. Also the understanding arose that quality of reason is measured by lack of secrets and "shrines". It was already something. But to the radikalshchena of the Pavlovsk opening of homo was still it is not ready. By the way, the first experimenters smelled rat. Having thought that just about will finish off "mentality and interior", professors put the tail between the legs. Guilty smiles became obligatory komponenty their reports. It became clear: finished badly. Though … the Acceptable committee of SPB warned about inevitable consequences of such researches still in 1866. Let's remind. Forbidding Sechenov's work about brain reflexes, the committee summarized: "This composition is the materialistic theory which deprives of the person and consciousness, and free will", "subverts all concepts about moral duties, about sanity of crimes", "destroying moral bases of society, destroys a religious doctrine of life future; it does not agree neither with Christian, nor with criminal and legal view and conducts to depravity of customs. Therefore is liable to prosecution and destruction as extremely dangerous on the influence on people …" Let's note that this summary extremely precisely and correctly characterizes this work. It really destroys moral bases, conducts to depravity of customs, destroys belief. Fortunately, put quite so and is. And scandalous experiences with homeless children were natural development "extremely dangerous" sechenovsky work. In the Pavlovsk laboratories that just came true, about what the Acceptable committee warned: the scientific chasm yawned and … put out the tongue at people. As to the finished fools.

Putin and revolution. Face to face
Already not less three centuries of first need of Russia is revolution. Of course, in the history of this country there were a swirling of crowds and shooting of tsars. But all cataclysms came to an end with simple replacement of one despot by another. The symbolics and attributes were replaced, but the principles of the power remained invariable. Tsars, secretaries general and presidents inherited from each other the pleasant right to execute or pardon millions. Of course, someone from ventsenosets wrote great power statehood with a water color, and someone oil. But the essence never changed. Style of architecture is indifferent for a good earthquake. It crumbles a gothic style with the same pleasure, as well as a modernist style. It easy demolishes the whole countries. Revolution, unfortunately, is not so omnivorous and omnipotent. Besides she knows Russia on taste and well remembers how she few times choked with it and belched, without having finished business. Of course, she always wanders nearby, choosing a moment for a new throw. Meanwhile any distemper did not manage to crack hulk of the dark empire. Yes, there were very picturesque attempts. But Russia so never also endured original revolution. Revolution is not just emetic reflex of the country in response to petty tyranny and theft. Not guillotines. And the cellars of ChK which are not filled with corpses. Cellars and guillotines – only juicy, but not obligatory spices to a dish of the state transformation. Revolution is an irrevocable change of the principles of life and management. It is the painful, but necessary act of political hygiene changing the nature of the power and the people. But in Russia revolution did not happen. By the way, it is not quite clear that it blocked. It is silly to suspect of it Orthodoxy. It exhausted and turned long ago in state show business. Especially well it is noticeable in comparison with Islam which regularly shows those acts of faith

which spitpoisons call "terrorist attacks". Modern Orthodoxy from its donosika on the 148th looks on this background very faintly. And once and it shone in religious terrorism, pulling out nostrils, burning the whole families in fellings. But already at the beginning of the XX century the degree of belief went down to zero. However, it is a trouble not only Orthodoxy, but also Christianity in general. Of course, fathers and patriarchs continue to play an old performance, washing and kissing legs to bums. But we will note that any prostitute and not it kisses for much smaller money. Out of suspicions and "great Russian culture". Fortunately, it for hundred percent is secondary and is the obedient copy of culture European. And that never disturbed a celebration of revolutions. Mythical Russian "originality" can interfere with nothing at all. If it ever also existed, then as senseless ballast it was dumped still Peter I. Secret expedition, the III Office, VChK-KGB it is possible in general in calculation not to accept. They are unsuitable for blocking of big political processes. The problem is that they are formed not of complete fools. Therefore, in any serious situations they the first also run up. However, the riddle of a failure of all revolutions in Russia is a subject of a separate research. Today we let's manage simple registration of that fact that political evolution of the country did not take place. Of course, it is possible and to do without revolution. But, alas, the admission in the future is written out by her. In addition, revolution washes the country from vicious traditions and administrative carrion. Such deposits are saved on any majestic design, and Russia is the especially started case. In the 21st century she entered, without having tested any revolution for all the history. it the deep mechanism was never updated. It still rumbles, generating a lie, fear and war. Certainly, Putin's autocracy automatically inherited both this mechanism, and century accumulation. It also could not be from them free. The one who sees the main evil in Putin is guided by amusing representations about "a role of the personality in the history" and does not understand that Napoleon is not properties of the specific character, and only the name of the lottery ticket which almost any person of the corresponding era could pull out. Approximately the same story and with Putin. It only next puppet of Russia. And for its threads pull those traditions that 300 years were not updated. Putin's government does not contain either original lines, or his personal imaginations. It only diligently follows the standard of the Russian imperial administration. All its actions – direct logical continuation of behavior of Russia through many centuries. The one who claims that "Putin is Russia" is right. However, that circumstance that at the word "Russia" a set of meanings including frankly dreadful is missed. Not compatible neither with the concept "civilization", nor with the concept "present". Syrian arts, capture of the Crimea, Donbass, obscurantism celebration, omnipotence of secret police, etc. – these are natural and inevitable sprouts, prushchy from rhizomes of the Russian imperstvo. And Putin is just good gardener: it cherenkut escapes in time, waters and pits a plant louse. The one who admires Russia is obliged to admire also Putin. Certainly, again exposed the stale Russian god. What is not surprising. The security officer's brain – easy production for priests. However, if priests were not, then surely there would be some other dirty trick. But under a hand they turned up – and again coercion of the country to Orthodoxy was ready. The people were called "bogonosets" again, and he assumed a dignified air. By the way, from a bogonosnost there is also a direct practical sense. It is a fine anesthesia. He allows not to notice even death. Industrial, financial, scientific, etc. Possibly, another Russia to be and it is not capable. It cannot but steal, not take, not force, not suppurate and not mrakobesnichat. Alas, it fateful country. Having changed the principles of management, it will collapse. And if keeps them, then will finally undock from a civilization and

will die from it hands. The last tractor operator will crush the last goose – and everything at last will end. Lack of revolutions for nothing still passed to nobody. It is necessary to say goodbye to illusions. Intellectuals namechtat to themselves "the" Russia. Russia real gave them the chance to jam dreams camp solid oil. But they did not sober up, and still took offense more strong at reality which has no the slightest similarity from them dreams. This offense is so strong that today's intellectuals do not notice a gift which is made on the quiet to them by Putin. Having hung on lamps, they would lift the personal rating of the gardener to 100%, and national triumph would exceed even "the Crimean degree". But it is allowed to them to live. And even to pokuchkovatsya in tiny reservations for persons with the wrong thinking like "Echo" and "Snob". But, most likely, it not generosity, and economy on soap and ropes. As it became clear, turncoats are absolutely harmless. Their intellectual tricks are indifferent for the population. The people are very busy. He licks lips, remembering sweet of shoe-polish on Stalin boots. It is under construction to immortal shelves. Of course, the Russian statehood has adorers. For example, clever Kadyrov. But it is necessary to remember that he loves it approximately for one billion rubles a day. And for such money even I it loved. Other admirers of the Russian idea it is not looked through. It becomes more obvious to the western pragmatists that death of Russia would be the benefit for a civilization. it contribution to the general development of the world it is incommensurable less, than the problems created by it. From it constantly bears war and bottoms. it the kozyryaniye bored with participation in World War II long ago, and declarations on a clear victory over fascism became amusing. Fascism lives also is well including in Russia. Its ability to be installed in any nation and it to kuklovodit is not lost. Perhaps, fascism waits the star hour and on whose party this time Russia, to put it mildly, it will not be obvious. Pragmatists and their nasty sobriety it would be possible to ignore. But, unfortunately, they solve to whom to live and to whom to die. Remains riddle that complacency with which the West watches our gardener. Notice that from a snuffbox dust is not even blown off. However, this condescension has the explanation. On poison of today's Russia antidote is produced long ago. To the world it is not dangerous. Its structure is known: despotism, bottoms, war cult, theft, obolvanivaniye, etc. In export attempt all these traditional values are easily identified and neutralized. And here locked within state borders of the Russian Federation, they will finally poison the country. The problem of Russia will be solved by itself, and the world will sigh with relief. The main thing that the players of poison were not changed, and new, unknown details were not added to the mechanism of autocracy. And that Russia will hide, will pretend to be the unfortunate, but developing poor thing reaching for progress and democracy again. And when will save up force, will pass from a simple robbery of neighbors to more serious to tricks. And Putin is good just the fact that he is not inclined to imaginations and innovations. He embroiders only on an old imperial outline. It conducts Russia to isolation and ruin it is so predictable, it is sure and beautiful how nobody will be able to conduct more. Following logic of the western thinking, does not follow it at all to prevent to govern. What here, to whatto mouth, snuffbox? However, it is worth to remember about revolution. Perhaps, she will forget old offenses and nevertheless will undertake for Russia. Last time. Undoubtedly, it will make all future processes much more picturesquely.

As we already established – discovery is first of all very high degree of a faultlessness in assessment of this or that private phenomenon or property. Now we will observe behind that, it is transferred whether from great opening "a faultlessness factor" on everything, in what ours were sure "great openers". Let's begin with Aristotle believing that meteorites are "evaporations of the earth which rise up, and approaching the certain "sphere of fire", загораютсI vn also fallз». It is possible to remember its interpretation of existence of paleontologic remains: Stagirit explained them with actions of "underground imitative forces which copy the events on a surface". Here. Newton believed that all messages on meteorites – a silly invention because to them in general"there is no place to fall". Also, "on the basis of comparisons of astronomical and historical proofs" it defended own passionate belief that the age of Earth does not exceed six thousand years. F. Bacon passionately argued on a role of witches in a pogubleniye of crops, V. M. Bekhterev was an admirer of "tsvetoterapiya", U. Gladston claimed that ancient Greeks did not distinguish color, and great Libikh was it is convinced, that yeast is not live organic chemistry. Robert Boyle demanded that miners represented report, with what depth of terrestrial thicknesses begin"dwellings of demons", and as look them"nests", and Byuffon declared that in North America evolution goes more slowly, than on other continents. I. Kepler claimed that craters on the Moon are erected by lunar inhabitants, K. Flammarion was sure that on it there is vegetation, and Galilei convinced that Kepler's thoughts of influence of the Moon on inflows and otliva in the seas and oceans of Earth – "a nonsense and childishness". Kepler was it is convinced, that color –"it is a thing absolutely other than light, certain quality, staying on the surface of opaque bodies». Copernicus did not doubt available the "crystal spheres of the sky" described by Ptolemaeus. It only corrected the Egyptian, having reduced the number of "spheres" with 80 to 34. This lovely delusion is even taken out in the title of the main work of his life – "About rotation of heavenly spheres". Lord Calvin declared that X-rays are a fraud that no airplane will be able to fly, and in 1900 expressed confidence that nothing new in physics can be opened already. Jean-Joseph Vireille in the fundamental work "Estestvennая history of the human race"1 claimed that Blacks emit sweat black colors, and Rutherford that commercial use of atomic processes is impossible in principle. Quietly to Braga insisted that around the Sun all planets, except Earth, which rotate remains motionless. Joseph de Laland claimed that probability flights in the balloon – the empty imagination, and the French Academy of Sciences in full strength laughed at the idea of the lightning rod. She

laughed at differential calculus of Leibniz, over the theory of telegraph and is so categorical fromritsat existence of aerolites,1 what demanded them to remove from all museums. Great Christiaan Huygens considered deficiency of hempen ropes main problem of the planet Jupiter. According to Huygens – existence "at it" four moon2 incontestably confirmed a nespokoynost of the seas of this planet and, respectively, need of very large number of a heavyduty rigging for the fortress of sails of the yupiteriansky fleet. Edward Clark3 warned that education of women leads to "drying" at them of a uterus, and the most authoritative гинеколоof the time George Nefeys4 convinced that masturbation conducts to weak-mindedness. Sir Artur Kizs headed and organized that respectful round dance which the paleoanthropology of the first half of the XX century drove nearly forty years around t remains. N of "the Piltdaunsky person".5 A. Saint-Dyerdyi taught that protein installs electrical equipment though actually it is the insulator. This occupied register can be continued almost indefinitely: Leibniz rejected the Newtonian ideas of inclination; The Tesla and Marconi assured that they get radio signals from Mars; Darwin passionately preached and developed the ridiculous theory of pan-genes; Richard Owen could not find a hippocampus in a brain of a monkey; Kyuvye proved that evolution is a full nonsense; Karl von Ber categorically denied likeness of live organisms; Edmund Galya believed that Earth has internal spheres, too surrounded the atmosphere which, escaping outside, forms a polar light; D. Priestley was it is convinced in existence of a flogiston; R. Virkhov laughed at the real skull of the Neanderthal man, having made the authoritative kraniologichesky conclusion that it belongs not to the ancient person, but the Russian alcoholic Cossack of the 19th century; U. Gopkins and Ch. Layel were convinced of nonsense of the statement of L. Agassis, as if ice it is capable to move boulders and therefore suggested not to discuss even the idea of movement of stones by glaciers as ridiculous; A. Vezalius categorically opposed division of nerves into dvigatelnaе and sensitive; K. Varoly6 claimed that the cerebellum is body of sound perceptions; Dalton was it is convinced, that the forward camera of his own eye contains liquid of blue color and that this anomaly decolours for it the picture of the world; Galvani until the end of days stayed in confidence that opened the "an electric fluid" capable to revive dead organisms. So, even on the basis of this laconic selection we see that the most brilliant chemists, physiologists, physicists, geologists, having slightly gone beyond the narrow competence, were deeply mistaken in estimates of the major phenomena and the facts.7 Why we сейчас ridiculous listed these and8 shameful errors of magnificent scientists? Reminding that mistakes remain mistakes regardless of "height" with which they sounded.

All greatness of Ch. Layel not gives any weight to his delusions about glaciers, and Virkhov's importance does not turn an original skull of the pithecanthropus into remains of the Russian Cossack. In other words – we not has the right to give to god's hypothesis1 it is more than value, than a problem of deficiency of hempen ropes on Jupiter. "Owen's hippocampus" and "signals from Mars" of Marconi – fine examples of that nonsense by whom it would not be told – nonsense and remains. And now let's return to the question "faultlessness" and let's bring results. Speaking about creators of science, we speak about the people having figuratively speaking scientist degree. And that it good, deserved scientist degree? It, first of all, instruction that this person so profoundly it is busy with the one and only specific question that cannot just have opinions on any another. The most brilliant enlightenments in the most important of sciences do not save from a blindness in so general and polysynthetic question as "god's hypothesis". However, as well as in any other. Certainly, science above any "morals", and are not applicable to it it norms. But, besides conditional "morals", there is also a certain "everyday" measurement where convictions great scientists created2 very vital issues, both for other homo, and for development of a look in general. In this regard we will remember still several important facts. The opener of a big circle of blood circulation in a body of the person, the physician U. Garvey, personally inspected skin of prisoners of Inquisition, determining by existence on it "tags of a devil" extent of communication of the defendant with Lucifer. In 1633 a certain Margaret Johnson's life depended on its expert assessment. Garvey revealed on it body traces of "gentle touches of a Satan" and the young lady, certainly, burned. The Nobel laureate Julius von Jauregg infected mentally sick with malaria and tuberculosis, and Albert Neicer of healthy people – syphilis to have an opportunity to study the clinical course of this disease. Lavoisier publicly burned down books of the opponent Shtal, and Franklin and Gray used children in very painful electrophysiological experiments. Nobel laureates – Hans Wilhelm Gejger, Johannes Stark, Max Planck and Philipp Lenard voluntarily and sincerely cooperated with Hitler's regime in production of the German atomic bomb. Ervin Schrödinger through the open letter, placed in all newspapers of Austria and Germany, assured public in the admiration of Adolf Hitler also swore to it fidelity. Of course, all3 Verner Heisenberg outdid. His name needs to be said "having taken off a hat". And it is fair. We remember that this person not only conquered the highest intellectual peak of the present – the quantum theory of the field, but also partly it built. And the same person was it is keen the idea to arm the III Reich with nuclear weapon. Heisenberg was the author of that reactor in which there was an uranium enrichment for future atomic bombs of Germany. With account where they could be dumped and what number of laboratories and the major scientific developments would be burned to ashes – Heisenberg's hobby, most likely, was an essential mistake.

Perhaps, the personality scientist, with1 inseparable from it religious belief comprises lines which uniqueness allows to make a contribution to science? Let's remind that interrelation of the personality scientist and its opening it seems the undoubted and standard dogma. In the best way this thought was formulated by the neurophysiologist, winner Nobel Prize John Carew Ekklz seeing in the fact of discoveries the best proofs of free will of the person and his communication with supermundane force. James Dewey Watson, too Nobel Prize laureate, sootkryvatel of structure of DNA and author"Molecular gene biology", which by right it is possible to call one of the most important books of mankind, believed that"Each step2 forward, and sometimes and back – the event deeply personal in which the major role is played by human characters and national traditions is very frequent».3 At Watson as we see, the role of the personality in opening is extremely concretized. Still other Nobel laureate – Christian de Duv who writes that "Creation of the theory is is more categorical intense the creative process which is bearing the impress of the identity of the author". It characterizes the Einstein theory of relativity as "a print of the individual, personal traits peculiar only it to the creator" At first sight this point of view seems only logical and possible. But only at first sight. And at contact with the facts and logic from this assumption not remains even "loci udi".4 The matter is that very many major inventions, basic detection, detection of laws of the nature and properties of matter were almost synchronously made scientists not connected among themselves in any way, completely independent from each other, carried national, geographically, socially it is also religious. Let's bring short selection of the facts; i.e. we will list those discoveries which were made "independently" and "at the same time": Cavendish and the Pendent opened the law of an attraction and pushing away of electric charges; By Paracelsus and U. von Gutten it is declared about influence of syphilis on a head and spinal cord. Zh. Zhansen and Lokayer – made the spectral analysis of prominences of a solar disk; Ramzayem and Langle are revealed properties of helium; Darwin and Wallace – formulated the theory of evolution; Adams and Leverye – found the planet the Neptune; Marconi and Popov – invented radio; Oparin and Haldane – opened the principles of an abiogenesis; Marriott and Boyle – calculated features of behavior of gases; Augustus Tepler and Wilhelm Golz – invented the influence machine; Caesar Skaliger and Tsezalpini Aretsio гипотезирovano existence of a kinesthesia;5

Gay-Lussac, Jacques Charles and Dalton – output the law volumes; Von Gerike and Torricelli – are defined properties of vacuum; Zh. Fernel and P. Forrest definitely the poisoning influence of mercury on a brain; Galilei, de Chezo and Olbers – solved a paradox of blackness of the Universe; Borelli and Zhyuren – found the capillary phenomena; The hertz and Lodge – recorded electromagnetic waves; Thomson, Dzhermer and Devisson – deciphered diffraction of electrons; Newton and Guk – it is defined law of the return proportionality to a square of distances; Huygens and Galilei – created the pendulum clock; Kotunyo and Morangdi – is found out a role of a likvor and laws of its circulation between brain ventricles; Descartes and Snellius – opened effect of light refraction; Bennet and Eandi – simulated the electroscope; Sheele, Priestley and Lavoisier – is classified hydrogen; Malpigy and G. Badzhlivi fixed the mechanism of developing of a hemiplegia; Maier and Joule – the principle of equivalence is understood; Galilei and Sheyner – found spots in the Sun; Latur and Faraday – established liquefaction of gases; Dalton and Volta – described behavior of vapors; Mendeleyev and Meir – opened the periodic law; Veynberg and Hardy – proved the law of genetic balance; Russell and Gertsshprung – made charts qualifiers stars; By Murray Gell-Mang and J. Zweig – it is written quantumWai model of elementary particles;1 Möbius and Lister removed a paradox of "Moebius band"; Lobachevsky and Boyai – developed hyperbolic geometry. The list can be continued, but, we believe that given there is enough. Certainly, our index is not faultless, and on separate positions and дискутивен *, but existence certain regularities, undoubtedly. There is an ambiguity with authorship of "the return square". Both its independent "opener"2 could not assume that so specific task occupied someone during long time still and still by someone it could be successfully solved. Guk and Newton mutually accused each other of plagiarism; in 1680 in Royal society beautiful and detailed scandal took place, but then, having got acquainted with draft copies, letters and developments of each other – the parties with astonishment reconciled. Doubts and as regards a primogeniture of discovery of effect of light refraction, but, despite very careful investigation of this history by Leibniz, Huygens and many others are possible, any proofs that Descartes knew of Snellius's developments it is so received and was not. Having attentively studied the list and scrupulously having compared dates, we will also see that opening not always kalendarno coincide, year a year, month a month. Sometimes they are carried for years and decades. Nevertheless, they remain made independently from each other as later author could not be knows of any works in this direction someone still. I will explain. Cases when were not rare opening, made earlier, for various reasons it was not published, remained to completely unknown contemporaries and it was found in its archives already great-grandsons. As a good illustration serves the find in G. Cavendish's archives of full development of the law of pushing away and an

attraction of electric charges which later there were found decades by Maxwell. We did not include in the list numerous and too almost simultaneous inventors of the telescope, i.e. D. B. Port, Lippersgey, F. Mavrolik, as, besides them at it was still it is a lot of "fathers"; and also "simultaneous" authors of a kaleidoscope, refrigeration units, balloon, helicopter and so forth. So, we were convinced, that scientists, having between themselves nothing in common on education, by training, on beliefs, not acquaintances among themselves – approximately at the same time came to the same conclusions on the most important questions of the universe. Even in our short example – and that dandies and gloomy hermits, ardent fascists and sad Russian engineers mixed up, distinguished academicians and brewers, merry fellows and melancholiacs, fanatical Christians and atheists, convinced bachelors and approximate heads of families, plebeians and aristocrats, and also – burgomasters, communists, royalists, peers, revolutionaries, priors of monasteries and duelists. Listed by us – only a visible, official part of images great scientists. In most cases sensitivity did not allow biographers to go deep into some features of their life, habits and bents. But we know that at any homo there is very picturesque "back". Also we can assume reasonably that distinctions between svershitel of the same opening were still is more striking, than it is a zapechaperishably in their official lives.1 In other words, we have quite the right to assume that between von Gerike and Torricelli, Marriott and Boyle, Marconi and Popov there were not just "differences", and whole "abysses". And nevertheless, they at the same time came to the same conclusions. All personal, national, religious, household, political differences did not play any role for scientific result. But perhaps, this not coherence of opening and the personality is inherent only relatively in local enlightenments? Perhaps, the most grandiose theories nevertheless are based on certain unique lines of their creator? No. As we can be convinced – the regularity noticed by us extends to any opening, irrespective of their scale. For example: Charles Darwin and Alfred Russell Wallace never met and did not communicate. Till 1858 Darwin did not know about Alfred Russell's existence. But in June of the year stated above Wallace sent to Darwin article sketch" To a tendency of independent emergence of variations from an original form». Having unpacked a package, shaken Darwin saw in Wallace's lines the own theory which nuances he hid till time even from so close friends as Hooker and Layel. "I never saw more amazing coincidence. If at Wallace my draft copy written in 1842, it could not Sochithread for it the best summary".2 Certainly, there are theories not less global, than evolutionary. It is quantum, abiogenetichesky, relativities, conditioned reflexes and a genetic code. All of them have very ambiguous origin too. At everything3 awe of Einstein, Oparin, Pavlov's names, Shout, Schrödinger – none of them are impossible назto vat "authors" of these theories.4

Einstein opening can be marked by his name very conditionally. Herman Minkowski developed mathematical system of coordinates without which HUNDRED would never be born, and Gilbert created all mathematical basis for the General Theory of relativity. Direct coauthors of Einstein are Maxwell, Fitzgerald, Larmor, Lorentz and Poincare. In fact and HUNDRED and FROM – collective work. Abiogenetichesky concept,1 it was independently developed by Alexander Ivanovich Oparin and John Haldane who were very much reliably are isolated from each other by geography, a difference scientific шкоin l and the most banal policy.2 First both took news of presence of "competitor" on other continent very painfully, but a situation3 the chivalrous Haldane who recognized Oparin's developments more saved capacious and large-scale, and respectively and more significant. Here, on the example of an abiogenesis we observe a role of purely external factors. They reliably protected scientists from each other. But, besides external factors, there were also others, sometimes still more influential, than geographical and political boundaries. They provided independence of commission of opening, even too in that case when scientists were not just in correspondence, but also in close scientific contact. Possibly, here nevertheless it is necessary to stop and concretize the concept "independence of opening in science". What is it? It is the term which we mark a certain high scientific result if to it came scientists, not having opportunities to borrow thoughts and the ideas each other. The best independence full provides, of course4 isolation of researchers from each other. But can also work with beautiful isolation centers: arrogance, conflictness, ambition and personal scientific weight. This thought seems not too simple, but it it is easy to clear on the example of the quantum theory. Listing all who were involved to it to creation, we speak about a great number of large, capricious and liberal characters. Very different – Planck, Bohr, Dirac, Einstein, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Rutherford, Louis de Broglie, von Nejmann, Paulie, Yordan – together erected the theory of quanta only for the reason that really equally saw a microcosm design. The facts did not leave to them the choice, maneuver. Perhaps, contrary to their will. With guarantee – contrary to their vanity. Absolute "independence" was provided here not with physical isolation, but that infernal arrogance for which all creators of the quantum theory equally were famous. Let's remind that neither for Heisenberg, nor for Dirac, without speaking about Planck, Borja or Einstein any more, "leads" of someone's authority never existed. Moreover. Each of them expensively would give for an opportunity to be trampled beautifully on the eminent colleague, having convicted him of a mistake.5

But … as we already noted, the choice was not left to none of them. Sum of the facts"rested blade in a throat" each of them, приговорив to1 to absolute2 to agreement of opinion in a quantum question. We will be frank: thoughts of absence rigid dependences between discovery and the personality scientist are not an innovation. In several боleu indistinct and illusive look3 they contain at Tyurgo, Condorcet, Godwin, Vernadsky, Choubin, Merton and Stigler. At Condorcet and Tyurgo they are obscured by intolerable verbosity and romanticism of style. Verninfernal was already slightly more concrete.4 He almost "groped" existence of a certain uniform world-wide and historical process of the knowledge which is a little depending on a personnel, persons and even on the general "progress of human societies". "We put forward independence of the main tone of the historical course of scientific thinking of a historical situation, unity of process. Obviously, it takes place for all mankind – out of distinction of the state organizations, races, the nations, public layers …Studying history of exact knowledge, we clearly see how before us something whole opens, deeply connected by one thousand threads withabout all history of mankind.".5 Our contemporary, not bad formulirovshchik Neil Choubin, relying on Merton and Stigler's works, very routinely noticed that "many great ideas came to different people practically at the same time" and that "any discovery is not called by the name of his pioneer … Rich history of opening – not a linear way from one person to the following, and a product of the social environment with the uncountable previous episodes, and as a result, many authors. Often inventor or the pioneer plays a less important role, than Wednesday which prepared opening, than that tto tell joint stock company, "soars in air".6 Everything is very simple. If to the room to pump yperite, chlorine or other toxic gas, then not all being in it will fall at the same time. Somebody will make it the first. The same story and with opening. Gradually there are circumstances and knowledge which makes discoveries inevitable are plused. Everything, as well as is always determined Wednesday, circumstances or their increased sum. Max Planck at an anniversary meeting of the German physical society formulated it with amazing simplicity: "Imagine the miner who with tension of all the forces conducts investigation of noble ore and to which the vein of native gold comes across once. And on closer examination it is infinitely richer, than it was possible to assume in advance. But! If this miner did not encounter a vein, then is unconditional, it would be made by his companion." And Max Born went still slightly farther, having calculated the following regularity: "process of accumulation and application of knowledge as result of activity of all human race during the long time has to follow the statistical law of exponentsialtny growth, and cannot be suspended".

We can carefully draw a conclusion that to us is not present and there can be no business to household habits or private judgments of this or that creator of science. All these composed persons have no value. Scientist can be the Satanist, the greedy person, the onanist, the spendthrift, the usurer, the pickpocket, the religious fanatic, the pedophile, the murderer, the slanderer, the envious person, the hero, the thief, the homosexual, the virgin, the normal libertine, the hypocrite or the scoffer, the gloomy taciturn person or the brilliant speaker. For result of its work all this matters no more, than a form of a cover of its coffin. He can be a self-educated person as Reaumur, Fahrenheit, Ampere, Laplace, Dalton, Kepler, and can be an abbot as Mendel or the journalist as Engels; the academician, as Oparin or the soldier who got an education on fields of war as Lamarck or Descartes; bookbinder, as Faraday, the school teacher, as Tsiolkovsky, the salesman in grocery store, as Shliman or the professional inhabitant of laboratories, as K. S. Leshli. And all this too means nothing. All these characters became history of science"naked", at an entrance having dumped cassocks, armor, frock coats and laboratory dressing gowns. However, as it becomes clear, business was not limited to clothes objects. Strictly speaking, in the same place, at an entrance all of them left also the names. The matter is that in the opening we never let's find signs of the personality of the one who made it. It is "surprisingly faceless" and is not connected with character, habits and views of his author in any way. Let's "untie" comprehension of DNA from names Shout, and for several minutes them we will just forget Watson, Wilkins, Franklin, Everi, Chargaff. Let's forget also the tragicomedy accompanying understanding of a role and "a spatial configuration" of deoxyribonucleic acid. Let's find whether we in spirals of the nitrogenous bases or as hydrogen communications at least echoes of that juicy fact that J. Watson did not know chemistry at all, and T. Shout had no scientific degree? No. Whether we in the solved sequence of an adenine-timina-guanine-tsitozina will see a sad shadow of O. T. Everi or a tear dying Franklin? Besides not. Let's not see. And now we will glance in a microscope eyepiece. Whether there is there a reminder on the Dutch clothier who gradually from crystals and glass and balls by means of which in his shop environment it was accepted to inspect quality of cloth, finished business to an opportunity to make out the movements of the spermatozoa "collected after a lawful coition with Mrs. Levenguk"? Whether some instruction on a style of his hat or on to what deity it bowed on Sundays contains there though? Certainly, no. As we see, all personal, together with "a question of belief" it dematerializovatsya again and disappeared as not having any value. Moreover, we had a reasonable confidence that between identity scientist and its opening there is no communication at all. We could mark great and small opening just in figures, but under the influence of culture we tie them to names of specific people.

Basis of the scheme of thinking always and everywhere from shaman the practician to Christianity was so-called "translyatsionizm". What is "translyatsionizm"? This idea of thinking as about mystical and initially incomprehensible act. "Something" in the person acts only as "receiver" of feelings, thoughts or desires, generated somewhere "out of" this substratum. Intensity reception this "signal", of course, fluctuates, depending on an era and stylistics of a cult. Also the option of full "external management" of the person and all it was possible actions without exception. So1 was during an era of animistic beliefs when the yesterday's animals who mastered the speech and thinking animated everything, from stones to bodies of own body. This situation the J excellently recorded the Milling cutter: "Old idea of the savage as about the most free of people contradicts the truth. He is a slave, but the slave not to some certain mister, and the slave to the past, the slave to spirits of the died ancestors who pursue it from the birth to death and govern it an iron hand." Over time intensity"reception" external teams probably changed a little. It occurred, when chaos of primitive spirits2 it was conditionally divided on "angry" and "kind". Later these groups merged in two clashing began and started an eternal fight because of authorities over the person and other seductive trifles. Respectively, each party intensively broadcast thought homo "good" and "bad", acts and desires. The range of deities and spirits was rather wide, and their influence on the person is boundless. Regardless of the main role quarrelsomeness, vindictiveness, lust, aplomb, suspiciousness, irascibility, an intriguing, authoritarianism and bloodthirstiness was inherent in all of them. It determined traditions of behavior obedient by it the person, very organically having legalized those qualities that homo got for миллионы years of "disgusting"3 unsociablenesses. It is, of course, very rough scheme of initial development of religion, but anyway the thinking was perceived as the granted instruction, but not as independent process in a brain. Such broadcastings directed acts of Saints, prophecies of oracles, feats of heroes, ekstatiky shamans. It is enough to look at word etymology"inspiration", which has more exact Latin analog"inspiratio", i.e. "dukhovkhozhdeniye". Here4 there is a question of "free will" and it roles in thinking. As we just established, some time of homo lived in the mode of cacophony of the mutually exclusive orders received by it from gods and spirits. It created logical, but not quite profitable situation, so as could not earn the main5 religious mechanism: charges, repentances, clarifications and reconciliations with a deity. The hieratic

priesthood toiled in clear melancholy: it had no opportunity to accuse the person of the dirty tricks and sins made by it. The victims to gods and spirits, of course, were brought, but it was a real trifle in comparison with what could give to religions feeling of constant fault of each individual. Owners of cults probably understood that the potential of "the market of personal fault" in thousands of times surpasses profitability of any hecatombs and burned sacrifices. But! The role of the person still remained insignificant. For all its incorrect actions it was necessary to punish not him, and translators of criminal instructions, i.e. spirits and gods, and these characters were certainly not punishable. With dictatorship of spirits it was necessary to finish. First of all, to establish personal responsibility of the person and to begin to earn normally from a situation. Abrahamic cults thought it the first and considerably cut down the staff of gods. From all assembly only the Supreme spirit to which send powers of "good" sokrashchenets and his main opponent who absorbed all qualities of "bad" was left. Between them was, the person for whom stipulated "some independence of god in some questions" is somehow squeezed, it- that was also named "free will". It was the ingenious invention. It provided financial greatness of Christianity subsequently. The person, at last, received the status of the player, but not a toy in the field of spirituality. Now he could be accused constantly – and consequently – and to constantly accept from him atoning sacrifices. However, "free will" did not assume ability to independent thinking. She only allowed to make a choice between various translators. Excellent illustration of a translyatsionizm are "Illiad" and the Old Testament. The most cool to researchers of "Illiad" noticed an originality long ago it heroes. According to J. Dzheyns – heroes of the homeric epos "consciousnesses are deprived". Certainly, "it does not mean that they sleep or are in a faint, but they have no internal life in our understanding". "They do not think, without having estimatedat the world, do not make decisions".1 Possibly, we deal with terminological again uncertainty. Джейнс calls by "consciousness" much more difficult phenomenon, traditionally confusing the banal sum of receptor "reports" to a brain to thinking. But in one it, undoubtedly, is right. Homer's characters are absolutely deprived of any independence, all of them – from Achilles to the Odyssey of a puppet of the whimsical gods leading not only their acts, but also thoughts. In the Old Testament2 freedom is left to the central characters only in the most primitive manifestations. In basic questions they completely cope a deity, who dictates them them thoughts.3 A bit later this relationship of a deity and the person will be very poetically formulated by the apostle Pavel in"The message to Jews" Here already through it as through a repeater, the Supreme spirit reports: "I will enclose my laws in their thoughts and I will write them on hearts them". With a set of variations, but the similar picture repeated in all religions. It is possible to glance to any country, during any era – and everywhere all standards of a miropoznaniye, all high samples of thoughts and feelings are the purest translyatsionizm of a "divine" origin.

Examples Augustine, Magicians, Nov, Cassandra, Luther, Krishna, Druidov, Iov, Rama, John the Evangelist, priests of the Delphic temple, Moisey, apostles, Sargun, Ishvar, Brahman, Vishnu, Rama, Shiva, Nirgun, Gilgamesh, Avalokiteshvara and so forth prove that all in the slightest degree worthy and clarified in thoughts of the person – there is a fruit of a certain broadcasting which to accept that was awarded in compliance with the selectness and will of "translator". "Sinful and dirty" thoughts and feelings remained in competence of demons, a devil, devils, evil spirits, demons, sukkub, or gods with negative role, it seems Ariman, Lucifer, Kali, Apop, Furies, Seth, Loki, Angro-Maynyyu, Eriny, Geyrreda et cetera. In what way broadcasts of both types came true and where exactly in an organism of homo "receiver" settles down religious knowledge does not specify. An exception is only the graceful formulation of the German humanists of the 15th century Jacob Spengler and Heinrich Institoris in their work "Malleus maleficarum".1 "If it is asked how the devil can make such illusion of feelings, without hurting in the head, then the answer it is easy. First, the devil does not split up bodies and does not change their essence, and only sets in motion images" the Idea of a translyatsionizm is live to this day. Picked up at skholast, but a little clumsily developed in the middle of the XX century by orthodox Saint Voyno-Yasenetsky, in the 21st century it was beautifully transformed to the scientific concept having a great number of supporters. In 2007 the sensational book P. Van Lomella was published "Infinite consciousness: A scientific view on okolosmertny states". The main idea of this work is that "consciousness is present at all Universe" as radio waves, and the brain is capable to catch them, "as radio receiver catches this or that program".

The modern anthropology does not suit us too in Virgil as long ago lost any lines of scientific discipline. Being very seductive habitat of various "ideas" about the person, it kontaminirovatsya over the last 50 years by psychology, philosophy, metaphysics and a frank fiction. Radical changes, "internal revolutions", certainly, are possible in any field of science. The reasons of such metamorphoses are various. Most often it occurs under the influence of the new opened facts and circumstances. But also the option when the volume of the saved-up material becomes so big that the fact of change of the sizes changes the settled meanings and treatments is possible.2 But in this case fatal impact on discipline was exerted by not new opening and conclusions, namely third-party influence. Partly here the same repeated a situation about which we spoke in the sixth lecture. I will remind that by the end of the 20th century science about a brain оказалась it is very significantly polluted3 psychology and metaphysics. Since 70th years impurity of these the practician became every year more and more and is more influential.

Over time this impurity began to distort significantly a real picture of ideas of work of a brain. She tried to tear communication of neurophysiology with the principles of an evolyutsionistika, comparative anatomy and the general physiology. It introduced unsteadiness and changed for imaginations a strict faktologiya. The science about a brain, however, was in much best family way, than anthropology. In it to basis there is TsNS physiology. It is strong, fighting and that is very important – uncompromising discipline. She despises conjectures and easily self-cleans, rejecting all that has no experimental base. Moreover – the tradition of this science contains antidote from philosophy and psychology. As we remember, it was excellently formulated Sechenov, Brock, by Pavlov and Claude Bernard. Thanks to two of these factors, cleaning of neurophysiology of "parasites" is, in principle, possible. With anthropology situation other. It has almost no evidential base, it empirical basis1 it is extremely small. Её founders were engaged generally in material moneymaking. Sometimes – its superficial structurization. They did not manage to develop for the discipline of rules of survival and safety. Therefore various parasitic practicians appeared "to crush" extremely easily under themselves anthropology. The podmyatiya technology has no relation to our work therefore we will outline it extremely briefly. It is easy to notice that philosophy,2 with boredom flirts with young and inexperienced scientific disciplines and very easily "seduces" them. It is not surprising if to take into account it experience and richness of techniques. Having tempted and having infected next "unfortunate little fool" with all the diseases, she, as a rule, throws it, finally, it is negligent, having specified a way in anywhere. It is entertaining that the anthropology and went exactly there where it was specified by it philosophy. On this way it became easy production of metaphysical significances and "high breaks". Acquaintance with it surely includes now studying of torments of a great number of authors, integrated ignorance of elements of physiology and the theory of evolution, but persistently looking for roots of the nedoumeniye in other, very sublime factors. Enormous accumulation of anthropological materials XIX and the beginning of the 20th century, of course, did not get to anywhere and remain at our full order.3 But! They are thoroughly gnawed by huge packs of "new anthropologists" why lost "trade dress". We know that any rodents, having bitten and having soiled, report to the spoiled invoice still and the aroma. The classical anthropology did not become an exception of this rule. It became permeated with the smell of primitive mysticism and significance. Today it is not clarity of Levi-Bryul, the Milling cutter, Spencer, Taylor, Durkheim, Rattsel and the Wound any more. This is even not "transitional" Malinovsky.

It is echoed by other vynashivatel веsma of the exotic ideas – Aiken3: "A lot of things, from what that was considered before as obvious, became difficult now it is unlikely tractable problem." As we see – today in anthropology everything is impregnated with "a mouse smell" of a heart-searching and far-fetched dramas. And there was it because of exclusively strong impurities anthropology those trends that декларирcosiness "incomprehensibility of the person"4 and independence of his brain from it is general evolutionary process.

solidary. Gudspid's researches gained recognition and popularity thanks to a set of publications, first of all very optimistical article "To a Question of Photography of Soul", placed in"New York Times» July 24, 1911. Ancient grenlandets perceived soul as the obligatory, but easily replaced detail. They were sure that I smother the sick person the good sorcerer easily can replace with "fresh", serviceable soul of a hare, seal or child. Russian peasants,1 fidzhiyets, gottentota and Ceylon veydakh were convinced that soul constantly moves on an organism, and to see it it is possible only while she leaves a body. In this case it takes a form of steam or "small dymets". The idea of "dymets" was supported and carefully developed by the Dutch physicists D. Matle and D. Zaalberg in their work"Mystere de la mort".2 Physicists even created a special catcher, supplied a large number of the indicators reporting about volume the soul which got to the device. For the sake of justice we will note that they were not innovators. still in the XIX century shamans seaside dayak, tying fishing hooks to fingers of hands, were able to catch the flying-away soul; and at nationality guide sorcerers used a big hollow bone in which they corked the got lost souls as required to sell them to the former owners or those who will wish to get still one, spare. Whether the bone was supplied with indicators – remained to unknown. René Descartes point лоappointed kalization of soul эпифиз.3 "A part of a body, in which soul, in my opinion, directly performs the functions – at all not heart and not all brain but only the part it located most deeply; it is the known, very small gland, распоlozhenny in the middle of its substance".4 It is hard to say, than the tiny shishkovidny gland which comfortably settled down between the top hillocks of a kvadrigeminus over the talyamus inspired Descartes.

It smokes all this on fire, and then having sewn upat in sacks of different size".8 Let's note that collect only souls of priests; the procedure takes several days and demands constant vocal maintenance and a drumbeat.

Concerning color and a smell of soul of data is not present, and here it weight – long time was a subject very serious discussions. In 1901-1907 in Dorchester, somebody Douglas McDougall1 weighed thex patients at the time of their death.2 The difference between the agonal and posthumous weight of patients equaled to about 21 gram. In 2000 in Oregon the sheep breeder Lewis Hollander from purely scientific interest destroyed several sheep on scales. In this case the difference made from 300 to 780 grams, and posthumous weight was more agonal. In 1998 Donald Carpenter undertook a research which result was a work"Physically weigning the soul". In it experiments with a set of dog and mouse death are in detail described, the set of schedules and tables is placed, but all conclusions for the unknown reason concern soul weight at elves. The last circumstance slightly depreciated the scientific value of work of Carpenter, but certainly, only for rough materialists. Plurality of versions about color, a form, quantity and dislocation of "the supernatural beginning" easily is explained by the different level of development of religious knowledge. The original state of affairs in this delicate question remains still unknown. It is difficult for us to judge who exactly understands it better. Eskimos and Platon, or tasmaniysky sorcerers and Berdyaev. However, it is not so important. Important what people in feathers, togas, cylinders, kukhlyanka, miters, homespun coats and white dressing gowns – unites firm confidence available souls. We can observe paradoxical similarity of views. It makes related the Papuan whose nostrils are decorated with the bone of a cassowary and the Russian philosopher passed through them in the varnished boots with twenty buttons.

For the choice of this name there is more good reason. Namely – convenience. It is impossible to find an image which would be so secondary and collective in all fixed history. The matter is that the evangelical myth is entirely stuck together from lines, properties, events, tragedies, scraps of "biographies" great number of gods of a classical antiquity.3 The exclusive value of the Gospel – in their absolute kompilyativnost.

In Jesus's destiny1 dramas and Osiris, Tammuz, Dionysus, Adonis, Marduk, Attis, Krishna's destinies, the Mitre and a set of other deities and spirits are concluded. Impudence with which "biography" of Christian god was sewed from scraps of the semistrangled magics and dead cults it is possible to excuse as haste with which new belief, and need to type though some biographic invoice for a new deity was created. Let's look narrowly. From the assiro-Babylon Marduk evangelical Jesus got a clownish crowning, a bagryanitsa, beatings, a crown of thorns, an execution, rescue of the people from anger of evil spirits at the price of the life, the policemen at a tomb who are running up in horror at the sight of the revived dead person and even entry into the city on a burro. From Phoenician Adonis and the Thracian Dionysus – all history with the dumped funeral veils, circulation on water, a cave coffin, and also some nuances of revival. From Phrygian Attis – water "baptism", transformation of water into wine, three-day the term of stay in death before revival, farewell "secret" vespers with pupils and "participle". From the Greek Asclepius – ways of healing of the blind man by means of a pasting to it a century saliva. From Gore, Dionysus and Hermes – the birth in a shed. From the Mitre, Gore and Krishna – shepherds or astrologers – the magicians who visited newborn god in "den", Christmas "star", a presentation to it"astrologers" certain prophetical gifts, history with beating of babies and flight.2 An evangelical story about beating of babies and flight has a great number of early doubles: it is a story about Appolon's mother – Latona hiding the son from Pifon; the myth about Izida forced to run with newborn Gore, escaping from Seth; legends of Sargon, Perseus, Romula and Ram, little Cyrus, etc. Possibly, this motive was one of the most tactical during that era. Let's note that one and all mentioned gods were uprightly conceived, were born in a cave or in a shed from mothers of virgins; the demon or an evil ghost offered all of them wealth and the power; all were able to go on water, to fly and cure; in total умерлand in "atonement" something,3 and all, certainly, revived. Some small nuances and details of an evangelical plot are borrowed from gloomy narrations about Osiris and Tammuz, and also from stories of gods and heroes both Greek, and other pantheons. Let's note that the realistic details borrowed from extremely popular certificates on bringing by fathers in the victim of own sons also are skillfully interwoven into narrations about Christ. Ancient history was rich with such precedents. It is enough to remember the acts of karfagenets of Maley who hung up the son Kartalon for the sake of a military udach which fascinated by dramatic nature antique publicand; Gamilkar, zaklavshy son4; besieged in Rub финикиян, bringing for atonement of the people of the best of boys etc. It is quite possible that need to implant a new deity in the exotic Hebrew environment forced to supply a legend of Jesus with several original "local" episodes, to powder color of a concrete era and to add with the texts connecting it with earlier folklore layer of the Old Testament. The fact that some absolutely innovative motives were cut in the evangelical text is improbable.

We know that even it "moral" part entirely of a plagiatirovan from the Egyptian and mitraistsky sources, and the fact "rises" is only deification of the old kind levitation described still Lukian in his story about "giperboreysky conjurers". In innovations, by the way, no need also existed. On the example of comparisons of texts of the Old Testament with other folklore monuments of that time J. Frezer in the work"Folklore in the Old Testament" proved that practically all texts of the Bible are not independent and original. At the beginning of already our century fundamental and very modern analysis of bible and evangelical texts was made. In spite of the fact that the proof of forgeries of authorship of the text was its main objective, it in general confirms also a part of conclusions of the Milling cutter about the borrowed syuzhetika. I mean Bart Ehrman's work "Great deception, scientific view on authorship of sacred texts".1 Moreover, the Milling cutter very clear explained that originality was appreciated much less, than good arrangement of "vagrant plots". There are no bases to assume, as compilers of the gospel were inclined to an excess fantazerstvo. They too, apparently, not bad knew the market of religious texts and tastes of public which acquired folklore motives, familiar since the childhood, easier, than any innovations. Even the name "gospel" – an example of a typical environment. Quite so very clear and popular messages on birthdays were called in Rome emperors,2 and running this term was still from Homer3 This property of the gospel can seem someone an essential shortcoming. But actually it is huge advantage. Having organized all paranormal precedents of antiquity "under one cover", it saves us from need to deal with each deity separately. As Frankenstein's creation bore morphological features of those people which of remains the doctor created the homunculus, and Christ "sewed" from all gods and spirits of antiquity is an excellent sample most sophisticated, drama and many-sided mysticism. Kompilyativny origin of the gospel gives them still the bigger weight as accumulates almost all system of religious knowledge of the whole millennium. The Christian theology without any strain found an explanation of this coincidence. According to Tertullian and other "fathers of church", certainly it"intrigues of a devil and demons». «To mock at Christ and to force people to consider that Christians only copy faith in pagan gods, demons became inspirers of mythology. Demons in advance knew what Christians will teach to and therefore they invented similar myths and ceremonies", and artfully played them to evangelical events.4 For us not essentially who exactly, Jesus or Tammuz dressed "bagryanitsa"; as specifically called god who suggested to eat with the first his meat and to suck blood for magic reunion with it; what of deities, Phoenician, Thracian or Phrygian entered tradition of obligatory circulation of god on water. It is clear, that each of the mentioned deities was not independently and originally too. Attis, Dionysus, the Mitre, Osiris and so forth, "are in turn made" of elements of the predecessors, gods too still earlier, and it is probable, more primitive which genealogies leave to spirits of the Neolithic.

Certainly, any deity has "expiration date". Sometimes it comes to an end together with features of a century which generated it and cultivated, sometimes the deity naturally loses credibility and is cancelled. And new era tears overdue gods on лоскутья to sew from them something fashionable and brand new. Gospel in this sense is fine material for the benevolent and impartial analysis, so how exactly in a "total" name1 all religious system of huge and very important era is concluded. To the word. The choice is also not left to us. Early Christians so diligent covered up tracks of an origin of the cult that they destroyed almost all pre-Christian sources. Of course, something remained. It allows to recreate an overall picture of antique mysticism today, but to work with very fractional and pieces of evidence on Dionysus, Attis and the Mitre, it would be etc. very difficult.

Evangelical events would be never noticed if not their supernatural component, t. е: revival, both the deity, and other dead persons, wonderful healings from a pasting saliva, the zombie's processions along Jerusalem, immaculate conception, circulation on a water surface and so forth. In itself "adventures of the rabbi during an era of the second temple",2 would remain to nobody the known and not interesting episode. Let's remember that Judaic history "centuries of Jesus" differs in an extreme ekzaltirovannost of all it participants, the highest degree of religionism, constant revolts, executions, storms and crucifixions. Very small time span accomodates such number of persons, tragedies, events, passions and death that thousands of years would be enough for other state for couple. The religious-national leaders lighting the people are estimated in tens; still not clearly, how such number of the characters combining oratorical talents with wild military courage and improbable love of freedom could be placed in close temporary space of 50-70 years? Judea is the 1st century the "burning", quasireligious substance capable without trace to dissolve in itself practically any destiny, any local drama. Pobitiya stones, an udavleniye, drownings, demarches of preachers, crucifixions of fanatics and trouble-makers were daily reality, sense and content of public processes. Just in case we will remind. The 1st century of our era is: Zakhvat and siege of fortress of Masad, where3 one thousand ancient Jews inspired by belief and hatred, committed voluntary mutually murder for the sake of "god, Israel and freedom". The Messiahs even the five-year-old children who died together with fathers positioned themselves there. This history is more large-scale and more tragic "evangelical", but it did not win the world and out of radical nationalist groups in Israel remained almost unknown. These are the bloody wars of Pharisees and Sadducees which involved in themselves all adult population and generated dozens of martyrs for the interpretation accuracy of "Abraham, Isaak and Jacob's law". This time of the professional Messiahs, "prophets leaders": Eleazara-bin-Yayra and Eleazara-bin-Shimona, Menachem, Shiimona-bar-Giora, Jonathan from Gushkalla, Judas

Galileyanin, Baar-Kokhby, Ioann Giskalsky, Anna and Jesus Iyerusalimskikh, Simona Arisskogo et cetera. It is a century of secret fighting sect сикариев, cutting anything who did not show hatred to Rome – and for it crucified by legionaries Guessiya Flora along all roads. These are daily, in each city, the town, in each village, at each synagogue – the hundredvoiced debates of Zealots and Sadducees passing into bloody fights. It is a century of the blood-stained bronze of the Roman legions destroying Iotapatu, Gamla, the Jerusalem temple. This time of sect of the Essenes who founded the whole cities of hermits where they invented thousands of the ways "mertvleniye of the flesh". These are, at last, times when at storm of Jerusalem by Tit funs and intimidations" thousands were crucified only for ", and the Jerusalem walls are demolished. On it, very picturesque background, including "among huge army there is a torturethe k giving themselves for gods"1 it was extremely difficult to be allocated and to be remembered. All remarks, reprises and Jesus's monologues, everything him "a precept and the sermon" would probably not make an impression even on his immediate family, not to mention descendants. The price and sense to all words of the next mashiakh were given by only those paranormal phenomena which accompanied them. Not incidentally authors of the gospel place such resolute emphasis on a supernatural component of adventures of the rabbi Jesus. "Revival", i.e. sharply paranormal fact of restoration of all physiological functions at the buried dead man is not casual it is the basis for Christian belief and it is carefully cultivated by church. She insists on unconditional, unconditional authenticity and all other 38 miracles described in the gospel. We will not analyze evangelical history – it has no relation to a subject of the real research. We speak only about a proportion paranormal and normal in this story which is an excellent concentrate of a magizm. As we know, it began with the fact that very much свirepy deity of ancient Jews,2 known for destruction of the whole cities, a nasylaniye of epidemics, diseases, cataclysms, and also drowning practically all population of the earth through organization of "flood", certain not explained in the way3 it was installed in a uterus of the Jewish girl and for some reason spent standard nine months of the prenatal period there. Most likely,4 Jehovah was forced to pass all relying embryogenesis stages as differently it could not be placed in a uterus without causing serious harm to reproductive system of the girl, and, above all, could not leave after the term of uterine fructification from it in the patrimonial ways, without having destroyed them. Having been born a usual order, the deity received a new "terrestrial" name – Jesus, and after a while got a profession of the rabbi, i.e. teacher and preacher, allocated прavy to preach in synagogues.5

Apparently, having despaired to re-educate ancient Jews by means of floods, rains of fire and massacre it decided to talk some sense their personal is executediy notations about love for the neighbor.1 Further the drama typical for that excited time is played: feasts, treacheries, sermons, loose women, legionaries, and a little chaotic marshirada from one Hebrew village to another. As a result – omnipotent and essentially immortal deity, played a performance of own death before enemies and admirers though it could not die in any way and not under what conditions owing to the fact that it was Almighty and immortal God, a sozdatel and manager of the whole world.2 After small term already buried deity, certainly, recovered and in full health appeared before public then, including the mission of ended, "rose". About rise, i.e.3 about vertical take-off we have in general no data. Gospel avariciously establishes the fact"take-off", uniform word, without concretizing the speed of a deity, its trajectory, the direction and other parameters flight. Without estimating this tangled mytheme in any way, without trying to look for in it sense or logic, we note again that paranormal component is in it a basic dominant. Basis of an evangelical plot is delightful ease, with which the main character breaks laws of physics, chemistry and physiology. It is extremely the traditional scheme inherited by Christianity from all those cults from which it was designed. "Prosrochennost" of gods who served as a set of details for new religion does not play any role since only their names die, and magic a component passes from a cult to a cult in relative integrity. Everything that told a deity and everything that the cult tells from his name always has special value just because it was confirmed with supernatural events and the phenomena. It and anything else gives to Jesus's remarks4 weight and importance. Here we see again that all judgments of religions about the nature of thinking and consciousness5 get the weight only complete with set couple of normal phenomena. We should understand: whether there are though some bases to say that such phenomena occurred in reality? There is a vital issue. At first sight we are deprived of an opportunity to check the nature of these miracles and the fact of their existence. All participants of evangelical events, as well as heroes of the Bhagavad Gita or myths about Gilgameshe or Adonis died long ago and did not leave any studied remains or authentic material certificates on the extraordinary opportunities. It will be difficult to us to subject to experimental check Jesus or Dionysus's revival, immaculate conception of Amenofis, Gore and Mitres. The situation seems desperate, but it not absolutely so. Let's afford innocent approximation, i.e. it is explainable difficult by means of simple. Let's assume that we should investigate a reproductive system of trilobit – long ago the diedout sea arthropods of the Paleozoic. But!

All models of these creations remained only if they fossilizirovatsya, i.e. hardened. Process of a fossilization1 is that gradually all molecules экзо or an endoskeleton dead organism are replaced with molecules of those minerals that dominate in the environment. There is a recrystallization which forever changes withto truktur of a trilobitovy armor,2 but at the same time all smallest details of its relief remain. In fact, the fossiliya of a trilobit is a mineral reconstruction of its armor. And here all the rest – nerves, gills, intestines, testicles, ovaries, muscles, i.e. all myagkostrukturny organic chemistry turns into homogeneous kaltsitovy, slate or gneissic mass. Most often, what is in a trilobit by no means and does not apply on withтатус "fossiliya" of interiors3 which shrouds the hardened armor over time. Why it occurs quite so? The matter is that soft fabrics decay and are washed away quicker, than there can be a process of a fossilization. Mineral molecules do not manage "to settle",4 on very ephemeral testicles or ovaries to communicate between itself and to repeat their windings. Fossilization – process long, and a sgnivaniye – bystry. Though it is impossible to exclude that in one approximately, a case from one billion *, on insignificant changes of shades in stone vnutripantsyrny weight, on differences it density can guess a part of internal structure of an arthropod which nuances repeated molecules of the replacing mineral. But such research always comes true on the verge of self-deception or even behind it. To put it briefly, it is almost impossible to establish features of a reproductive system of trilobit on their fossiliya. It is so impossible, as well as to define reality of evangelical miracles on the basis of stories of fanatics of a Christian cult about them. Both in that and in other case reliability will be approximately identical. But! In a situation with trilobita at our disposal there are their descendants – Xiphosura, i.e. recent mechekhvosta, sea arthropods. Let's take it is fresher, still five minutes ago the living being, is also accurate his otprepariruy. As a result we will gain complete idea of their reproductive system and approximate, but very probable how it was arranged at their cambrian or ordovician ancestors. It is quite possible that three hundred million years and introduced some amendments in length of yaytsevod or density of a network of testicles, but the principle of the organization of a reproductive system, undoubtedly, remained. On the basis of preparation of a mechekhvost we will be able to tell the following surely: trilobita, most likely were razdelnopola, had shorter, than the majority of arthropods of a yaytsevoda, and "female openings" were at them from the median belly line on each side and were covered with an operkulyarny plate. We have all bases to go further in our conclusions, and with certain by share of confidence to claim that trilobit had no special kopulyativny bodies, and fertilization happened out of a body of a female as it is observed at a mechekhvost now.

Having thought, we let's come to a conclusion that such device of reproductive system is the best for a being from such constitutionit and design of an exoskeleton.1 I.e. having investigated the descendant with whom the trilobit has a large amount of the general morphological properties, we will almost solve the ancestor. Approximately it is quite logical to apply the same scheme also to evangelical or other religious "miracles". It is necessary to find their recent "descendants" only. Let's look round around. The world including modern, is overflowed with various mysticism, belief, ceremonies, "sacraments" and so forth. Samples it it is possible to find in any church, church, synagogue, mosque. But aggregate state of church or sinagogalny mysticism does not suit us. Church miracles fossilizirovatsya long ago and are not subject to acids and a lancet. In "big cults" they exist only in the form of symbols – memories of events of thousand-year prescription. These are some kind of trilobita which it is senseless to be picked. Formally, of course, "miracles" are present also at modern church. In particular, such miracle is the Eucharist. According to a doctrine of Christian church "About a Metabole", under the influence of magic plasticity and songs of priests in certain the moment occurs transformation of a roll and red wine into meat and god's blood. Agree, it is difficult to imagine to himself a possibility of the detailed chemical, biological and molecular analysis of maintenance of an eucharistic bowl or detailed registration of the biochemical metamorphoses occurring in it. Even placement usual грadusnik in it or in the attendant2 so far it is represented business absolutely unreal. The lovely trick of G. Gamov who, being was the last known experiment in this area still boy, carried away from church behind a cheek the involved substratum and houses investigated it under a microscope. However, Eucharist, this rather boring "miracle". Its miraculousness remains invisible, intangible and not having any real manifestations and consequences. Strictly speaking, it comes true only at the declarative level and is registered in the category of "miracles" only on the basis of words of attendants of this cult. We need something is fresher and is more defenseless as "trilobita" of church miracles, besides the fossil, still also are protected by laws, traditions and fanaticism. Fortunately we near at hand have magnificent samples of defenseless magic. It: spiritism, a spiritualizm, clairvoyance, teleportations, so-called "extra corporal experience", various occult exercises with soul, extrasensory perception, wonderful healings and other "manifestations of the spirit" which "big cults" very imprudently left on worry to science. In essence, no fundamental differences between occult and spiritualistic practicians and traditional religious cults exist. Both those, and others are based on couple of normal phenomena, confidence available certain verkhovnoго supernatural factor,3 and also in reality of soul and miracles. Difference only in the status.

Of course, for thousands of years "big cults" were approved on pedestals of traditions, having got considerable welfare weight, but on "weight" mystical they are absolutely identical to any occultism. Orthodoxes, as a rule, fastidiously separate from occult and spiritualistic the practician, hinting at "their" incomparability and some "spiritists". In this fastidiousness there is no logic as a substantial part as "big cults", and spiritualistic sessions comes down to about one set couple of normal the phenomena and to ability to operate them. Both spiritists, and theosophists, and traditional Christians declare the purposes and ideals almost identically, varying phraseology only a little. Let's bring official formulation of an essence of the spiritualistic movement. "The spiritism is the general teacher, the great propitiator, the liberator of human souls from a framework of superstition and ignorance dispersing clouds of the delusions which were so long shrouding the world and the material lighting darknessny world.".1 As we see, it difference from installations of orthodoxes is insignificant what in this occasion would not be told by Christians. Theoretically, the difference between miracles of "big cults" and "spiritism clairvoyance" has to be no more, than between an ancient trilobit and a fresh mechekhvost. It is clear, that about full identity of the speech not goes,2 but on their key parameters similarity, undoubtedly. Judging by all, signs an occultism XIX, 20th, 21st centuries – the lineal descendant of ancient beliefs. But it still did not harden and, thanks to it, did not lose so valuable to us an issleduyemost. At first sight "bending of a spoon by force of thought" and Christ's revival the phenomena of one order seem incomparable events, but in fact it. Both in that and in other case laws of physics are roughly broken, dependence of organisms, objects and events with global rules of existence of the world is broken off. Magic and religion not basic distinctions, and only divide aggression of the orthodox clergy intolerant of the successful competition. This intolerance3 it is justified. Really, the main and only difference of so-called destructive cults from traditional "beliefs" is only that "destructive" provide the adherents with stronger feelings, than orthodoxes. The believing public is always the very young little fool who looks for impressions more brightly. And reaction of "big" religions to an occultism or sectarianism is a usual grumbling of the old man impotent man, indignant temperament of the lover of the eternally young wife. Anyway we are a little concerned by relationship of beliefs, religions, cults and magic the practician. Yes, their squabbles are amusing. Of course, each of them applies for individual possession of so-called "truth" and tries to blacken competitors. But on what basis statements of one religious group should give bigger weight, than to statements another? As the only argument in favor of "validity" of statements of orthodoxes only more effective style of their liturgical caps can serve. I am afraid, to us it is not enough.

In this regard would be to consider logically increasing and small, ancient and modern cults as a uniform complex which also their derivatives, i.e. esoterics, a spiritualizm, and extrasensory perception enter. Various egregors, hiler, mascots, revivals of dead persons, bendings of spoons, Eucharist, aura, meditation, telekineza, amulets, prayers, fortune-telling, resettlements of souls, immaculate conceptions, churing, icons, piramidologiya, chiromancy, acupuncture, meditation, astrology, bioenergetics, "туннelny" effects, plots, WTO,1 signs, contacts with souls of the dead, skapulomantiya, garuspikation, prophecies, asanas, dried the heads of a tsants and any other relics, and also a concept "soul", it is only mosaic components of large cults. To treat each of them apart there is no need though some of these phenomena are capable to exist and earn to themselves a living quite independently. The community of all religious manifestations was noticed for a long time. Helvetius, Voltaire, Golbakh, Lametri, Feuerbach have mentions of it, Yuma, Russo, Comte, the Milling cutter, Taylor and so forth. More distinctly others it Trezza formulated: "Interdependence of all religions from each other destroys the imaginary privilege of each of them on an original origin and on the fact that it possesses protection of the heavenly truth opened for mankind. The same interdependence destroys any supernatural element in any of them, finding a number of historical stratifications in formation of religions" It is quoted on A. Willa.2 However, grace of this formulation does not cancel doubts in a correctness of that mixture of religious manifestations which we made slightly above. There is the most important question: whether there is between religions, faiths, the phenomena, ceremonies and rituals so various at first sight a demonstrable "genetic" relationship? Whether it is applicable here3 concept of "a uniform genetic code", same simple and invariable what the sequence of the nitrogenous bases in DNA is? Alias whether there are at the heart of all cult actions a certain idle time and an invariable set of components, which, being combined, gives as a result life all couple normal to representations and rituals? Invariance4 such components, certainly, is. Of course, there is no such ease and magnificent negligence which we can observe in zhiznesozdayushchy cocktail from an adenine-timinaguanine-tsitozina. But at DNA and at belief components, most likely, nevertheless absolutely different authors. Being expressed with slightly bigger frankness, we can note that all religions and cults are made of the same fragments. And configuration of fragments and "appearance" of a cult – were determined by circumstances of an era, culture, i.e. Wednesday in which the cult functioned. It is not surprising, being natural development of the idea of primitive primitive magic of the Neolithic, one and all religions kept in themselves it main lines and tendencies. All of them crookedly or directly ascend to it to the main components primordialny magics: to contact, initial, katartichesky, contagious, ceremonial magics and a necromancy.

These six magics also are, in fact, "the nitrogenous bases" from which the "genetic code" of all religions replicating itself on each new round of development in the form of the next belief svivatsya. Now let's pass from the general to particulars. Uniform "genetic code" gives life to "elements" of which there are various religions. But if it so, then between them also the external likeness visible has to be observed unaided look. Approximately same, as between fins of fishes of Devon and a hand of the person. It, undoubtedly, is. As in modern organisms we see lines them far ancestors, and in world religions without effort we can make out "antsestralny" lines of primitive magic and ancient cults. As an example let's sort the known Christian plot – so-called "Maria's Annunciation". The legend of Maria and angel, undoubtedly, is a derivative of tradition of the "immaculate conception" obligatory almost for all cults, both world, and local. It is etc. very difficult to find some rather organized belief in which the deity would be conceived in the standard way in Assyria, Phoenicia, Greece, Ancient Iran, India, Cambodia, Rome, Judea, Syria, Mexico and would be born not from the virgin. The technology of fertilization of the maiden by god, of course, varies depending on an era and development of ideas of conception, per se. In the most ancient cults, when communication between sexual intercourse and pregnancy still was not obvious, fertilization could happen through an ear, a nose, the top, a touch to a sacred subject or just "at will". The goddess Nut, as we know, not being to the deputyzhy, itself conceives the children,1 swallowing them in the evening to give rise in the morning, and Atume-Ra is impregnated by own reflections about fertilization. But already slightly пto ozzha object of influence of god2 there are nevertheless the girl's genitals. Unfortunately, the anthropology cannot precisely establish a time boundary of establishment by the person of interrelation of boundaries copulation and child-bearing.3 Izvestnoh, that lingamichesky procedures4 were sometimes symbolical action, and sometimes and practical. In the latter case they were made only for the openings expansion into which the spirit of a deity could get if the girl appeared worthy this honor. The most ancient sample of copulation good luck can be found in the Egyptian history of magic conception of Amenofis. There, by the way, it occurred through a nose. God Tot played a role of the envoy who announced to the virgin priestess Mutemua will of god Nef and allowed it to smell анкх thanks to what there was a fertilization. In the virgin Maya,5 Buddha's mother, deity got through the top, having taken a form five color beam, in not less virgin mother of Zarathustra through a plant, and here in the maiden Koatlika who gave birth to god Uitsilopotchli, having taken a form of the flying ball from bright feathers.

A bit later at gods normal sex life begins – and in the Assyrian Milita's stump we already see the adjusted process of bringing in the victim to this goddess of virginity through banal copulation. The coition happened to Milita in total darkness of the temple and исklyuchat an opportunity to make out1 hairstyle goddesses. Over the maiden ready to copulation, "voice", informing all sounded in the beginning it about it selectness. Then there was an action. It anatomic was paradoxical as Milita was not only a deity, but also the lady, i.e. a being nevertheless not allocated penis. Nevertheless, quite heterosexual coition occurred every time without any misunderstanding and difficulties. Ancient cults of Cambodia did not allow any proximity of the newly married maiden with the husband until at all as it will try a deity. Tshin-tan2 was strictly obligatory. Here it was frankly carried out through the confidants having the status of "envoys" of god i.e. through priests. Sometimes copulation was symbolical. In this case only the genital participated in it god,3 made of a stone, metal or a bone. Priests in this case had only a role of toolmakers. They with sad singing entered to linga to the maiden into a vagina and or made them the expanding stirs, or imitated sexual intercourse.4 This ritual, widespread in the most part of the ancient world, Fillipinakh, in East India remained prior to the beginning of the XX century to Goa. The children conceived lingamy acquired absolutely special temple rights. In ancient Rome the first copulation of the maiden belonged only to god too, and came true by means of eternally eregirovanny stone penis of a statue of Priap. Curiously, as then fertilization cases were observed. Ancient Mexico made this procedure with the girl for the 29th day later it рozhdeniye.5 The procedure by means of a forefinger of the priest who fell into a trance always acting strictly for the benefit of the heavenly head was made. In sectsе Hindu sense Kaukilaus6 naked the maiden was stacked in the middle of the temple "believers chorus called spirit of the goddess which had to enter through rima pudendi in it vagina or in the bowl standing near the maiden with wine". At different times the procedure varied. Pregnancy sometimes had to occur from drinking of wine of Sakti containing spirit, sometimes from a direct penetration, owlsershayemy heads of sect.7 The Chukchi god Pivchunin was a bannert the tiny sizes.8 It used them including imperceptibly to get into rima pudenti of virgins and пosredstvo of immaculate conception,9 to bring the "bozhiy sons" differing in courage when hunting on walruses into world. At ancient temples of Shiva without fail lived"garudakh-bassois" terrestrial wives of god. As well as many other gods, Shiva in a sex issue it preferred to be installed for a while in one of the priests. The children conceived thus received the status of "the God's son" or "god's daughter", and their mother – the testimony of the purity. Approximately the same story is observed also in Wa's stumpal-Pshora which was practiced10 and Jews of "domoiseeev of the period".

Zeus and Apollon never missed opportunities to impregnate some stood gaping or sleeping Greek woman. All were outdone, of course, by assiro-Phoenician Tammuz. Being very skilled god, he probably knew that in serious questions on anybody it is impossible to rely and just in case uprightly conceived itself, having become at the same time and husband, and charming Ashtoret's son. Similar examples more, than are enough. Buddha, Gore, Osiris, Amenofis, Attis, Dionysus, Persy, Mitre, Adonis, Apollony,1 Sargon, Uitsilopotchli, Veynemeynen, Keltsatkoatl, Heracles, Asclepius, Dioskura, Hermes, Romul, Ram, is only a small part of uprightly conceived children of various deities. As we see, it was extremely fashionable to become pregnant from god for one thousand years to the known scene in Iosif's house so "immaculate conception" by the beginning of the 1st century AD became already a platitude. Christians created Mariolatriya including the doctrine about Maria's purity as to, and after the delivery not from good life. Of course, this postulate discourages gynecologists, but Maria has though some difference from the infinite maidens of antiquity who blameless conceived from god. As fairly noted A. Willa – "the Christianity would like to concentrate attention of all believers on untouched genitals of Saints, heavenly wives, innocent virgins».2 However, not only to Christianity:"Each of the elected righteous persons will receive inёны seventy guriya, besides those lawful wives, that were at it in mortal life. Every time when he wishes to enter Guria, will turn out that it is a devstvenna again". Hell-dynes-al-Sayuti3 tsit. on J. Drent De Oorsprong van de Wereld 2004. So, we distinctly we see that in the matter it is senseless to speak about the Christian Annunciation, as about a certain unique person. Evangelical Maria's pregnancy is cut out from a set of similar episodes of ancient religious folklore. It is also difficult to allow subject independence of conception of Jesus of a number of folklore "ancestors" of this incident, as well as to assume that the wheel of "Bentley" is not a lineal descendant of all those wheels, that earlier were invented by mankind.4 Having considered only one mystical event, we without effort found in it antsestralny lines of cults nearly of all antiquity.

Though still on the Bologna congress1 Karl Vogt designated a Christian ritual of an Eucharist as an example of a ritual cannibalism, we have no opportunity to prove that early homo were eaten each other within the sacral ritual. It is quite possible that for a deathbird and the cannibal which during millions of years was the early person the body of any dead person was only an opportunity to satisfy constant hunger. About a ritual cannibalism as we can speak about a fact in evidence only in the 20th century. In New Guinea the new leader of the tribe Faure ate a brain of the predecessor to seize his knowledge and cunning. Of course, this fact has to have and for certain has the evolutionary history, but to establish it it is almost impossible. We can be almost sure that the principle "admissions in itself through eating up" is an agemate of the socialized person. Eating up provided "communion". Thus not only properties and qualities, but also the spirits living in the eaten objects and beings could "be let in". In this or that look the participle existed at almost all ancient people, and till absolutely recent time – at Zulus, Bushmen, tasmaniyets, Papua, the Chukchi, yurak, Tungus etc. In more or less issued look we can observe a participle at the ancient Egyptians tasting special bread which at the time of the ceremony turned into flesh of the reviving Osiris. Brahmen of ancient India "were also familiar with the doctrine about a metabole or magic transformation of bread into god's flesh long before before emergence of Christianity".2 The Dionisiysky cult shows small "genre modulation", but is far from a plot does not leave. There are believers alive broke off calf also ate its meat, sure that under the guise of a bloody bychatina they eat the sacred body of Dionysus capable to grant them happiness and good luck. Ancient Mexicans made pieces of a body of the god Vittsiliputtsli which became impregnated svekolna of cornbreadm juice and after a number of ceremonies3 were solemnly eaten. J. Frezer describes it so: "They trusted, that, consecrating bread, priests turned it into flesh of god, and that, therefore, all who tasted it consecrated bread, absorbed a particle of divine essence and established by means of it mysterious communication good luck". In Mitraizm from where the participle directly passed to Christians, we find it practically in a modern look. And so in everything – to trifles. Even such trifle as a going into convent ceremony in a monkhood and lock cutting during the baptism ascends to everywhere to widespread to custom to bringing in the victim of hair. According to Dzhevons4 it is one of the earliest rituals celebrated still in Izida's stump. Also the fact that the Greek seamen cut off hair and threw them on wind is also known to umilostivit Poseidon. We can not continue search primordialny magics in sacraments of Christianity or any other religion. Even on the basis three given examples, obviously it total presence.

Its subject and semantic schemes wander on centuries, eras and the people, becoming more and more and more intricate, and authoritative. They do not change in principle, but acquire attributes, cultural meanings, theoretical justifications, staff of service personnel, and also enormous financial and administrative potentials. We already noted that similar thoughts are not an innovation. Usually they are used as atheism arguments, but those are not. For a dethronement of any concrete religion such arguments are effective. But they not only are harmless to the global "idea of god", but are even nutritious. From the fact that we were convinced of surprising similarity of sacraments and legends in all religions of the world the main point did not exchange. We it did not "cancel" god. Moreover, the idea of influence of supernatural force found still the big force and the importance as hundreds of separate cults merged in one global phenomenon accompanying the person from the moment of his socialization. Scales of influence of magic, of course, bewitch: Before us huge, huge eye of mass of people: Shlemobleshchushchy achaeans and bloody Aztecs, Russian guardsmen and Roman gladiators, French courtesans and Egyptian paraskhita, Judaic prophets and nobalevsky winners in literature,1 and also Dominicans, tractor operators, pianists, philosophers, Zulus, Templars, astronauts, foolishes, grain-growers, chroniclers, fakirs, miners, bakers, emperors, astrologers, Samurais, writers, plumbers, hunters, painters, gunners and druggists ….список it is infinite. These are inhabitants of the planet for all five thousand years of the fixed mankind history. They are about 100 billion. All of them are in a varying degree religious. They are very different, but in each of them worked and the uniform "mystical code" was implemented. It created their outlook, he directed the majority of their words and acts. Separated geographically and chronologically homo a century after a century, the millennium after the millennium invest the fears and hopes in almost identical abouttimes, plots and ceremonies. All of them2 are convinced that their thoughts are broadcast to them by a certain incomprehensible force, and in them lives it the part called by the word "soul". We see a real miracle. Hypothesis antiquity from an obvious counterargument changes in an evidential argument. The mankind reconsiders every century and rejects the outdated ideas of matters much less difficult than "god". About hygiene, electricity, medicine, ways of communication, a form and the place of the planet, society and so forth. It demands confirmation of any trifle, crucially eats in an essence of opening and laughs over nonsense and trustfulness of inhabitants of last eras. But in a question of "god" billions of these extremely mistrustful beings generation behind generation are obediently strung on a skewer of the concept which does not have in general any evidence and confirmations. People without hesitation accept very archaic, and owing to this fact and extremely primitive ideas of the main issues of life. Those that through the millennia to them is broadcast from the caves long ago dead savages of the Neolithic. It could impress.

But! Only under a condition if we forgot that we speak about beings with very small potential of a brain and hereditary dementia which appears through the majority of their beliefs and representations. And apparently, still in much defines their behavior. Limitation of personal opportunities of homo to the analysis and establishment of unevident communications between the phenomena, objects and organisms does a question of the number of adherents of the religious idea insignificant. Let's explain. To pass a thread in an ear of a thin needle an impossible task though for one armless disabled person though for hundred million such cripples. The number of the disabled people trying to do this a trick, impossible for them, of any role will not play. The thread will remain not passed. In the same way cannot be any mass of homo it is solved question of existence or absence of god. With account very modest abilities of the person to judgment of the difficult facts the number of supporters of the idea compromises rather it, than something proves. All this sounds hardishly, but probably the moment came to remember a smoke between bloody canines of a grizzly, terrible shout of Zemmelvays, a notorious lighter, and at the same time and the juicy fact that cerebral substrata initially have no the slightest concept about any gods, not to mention atheism, the good and evil. Certain the area of a brain can train to develop difficult reflexes for these concepts, and it is possible and not to train. Judging by with what ease when training it is possible onto change "good" and "angrily" in places1 just the same piece can be done with belief and disbelief. Here in the history of the relations primordialny magic and the person the most interesting begins. Let's assume that we learned 200.000 ducks at the same time to grunt at the sight of an inflatable ball. Demonstration of duck unanimity will make for certain a shock impression. Nevertheless, it will not be the proof of extraordinary properties of a ball. It will be only the testimony of skill of the trainer. The circle of "suspects" was narrowed. Now we needed only to find out who exactly is a trainer of 20 billion ducks. Supernatural force … or the priestly caste serving magic from first minutes it the births till today. In search of the answer to this curious question let's return to our "mechekhvosta", i.e. to lineal descendants of wonder-workers and wizards, to magicians and clairvoyants of the 19-20th centuries. We assume that the percent paranormal in a Phoenician deity, the bible Saint and the modern psychic can strongly differ. But probably at us will be enough scrupulousness, to find and record even microscopic traces something supernatural if they will be found in today's2 live medicines. We are ready to be content with a find even of the baby, even several "molecules" of supernatural. Anyway and investigated, except magicians of the present and their destinies we have nothing else tangible. All other certificates are only declarative and not checked in any way. Of course, at first sight, the correctness of comparison of spiritists, psychics and deities of antiquity is not indisputable.

But only at first sight. We should or learn to clean off from the phenomena and persons "gilding centuries" …, or hypothetically to put it on modern to us phenomena. The second is slightly simpler. In fact, – magicians, spiritists, clairvoyants and psychics are high priests and Saints of a spiritualistic cult. And their sessions - this real church service,1 what the world saw already much. By official definition Ontsionalny Association of Spiritists2 "The spiritism is the Science, Philosophy and Religion of continuous life based on a communication fact in evidence through mediums with those who lives in Inner world … The spiritism is an outpouring of spirit on mankind, a divine revelation from spheres of light. This royal word of the truth. The spiritism is the general teacher, the great propitiator, the liberator of human souls aboutt of a framework of superstition and ignorance".3 Spiritualizm is incorrectly estimated as generation of modern times. Perhaps, the bending spoons and other accessories eclipsed its primitive essence. And in fact, in it there is nothing new. This revival of one of the earliest forms of the evident magic allowing a possibility of communication with spirit of any subject or the person. Spiritualizm it is also necessary to consider, exactly, as a cult. If отбрto osit it4 modern signs to change clothes of his heroes, to move them to antiquity, to teach to speak by means of parables and to finish their acts by beautiful and painful death, we will receive the next mitraizm or Christianity. Besides related and the semantic spiritualizm has with global cults and direct formal link, recognized still in 1920 on Kogresse of Anglican Churches the pastor A. Beyfild who proclaimed that "This doctrine always was in the union with our belief. A spiritualist is in fact everyone "not the materialist", the Christianity also is spiritualizm religion" Elena Blavatskaya,5 Evzapiya Palladino,6 Daniel Douglas Yum,7 Margery Krendon,8 Elisabeth Kyubler-Ross9 and all other heroes of history couple of normal the phenomena for the adherents are figures as sacral as Christ, Tammuz or Krishna for the admirers. "Presently again the group of beliefs and customs which originate in depths of that layer of ancient philosophy where sorcery for the first time arose recovered. This group of beliefs and customs are what ordinary is called now spiritism …People again safely claim that incorporeal beings прhole influence a thought and matter".10

For understanding of the principles of work of TsNS dogs, of course, made more, than spiritists. But provided by spiritists жиhowl research material1 allows to separate real riddles of slozhnonervny activity from riddles, far-fetched and either to accept, or to exclude a question of influence on TsNS of certain supernatural factors. From times Sumer before the beginning of the 20th century we have a set of certificates on various miracles. Practically all of them quite keep within the modern concept "paranormal abilities and phenomena". It "prophecies", "prophetic dreams", healings, visions, levitations, revivals, "transportations", conversations with spirits of et cetera. All this descendants2 primordialny magics. As we spoke, the gospel, first of all, it is the book how the rabbi in the 1st century AD showed not too original, but quite standard samples of various magic. Approximately also we can characterize myths about Tammuz or Adonis. On a genre essence – it is subject grimuara. But also lives of spiritists and psychics of the XX century if to stand them in due pathetics and not to sadden inappropriate irony anywhere is grimuara, narrations about life, acts and tragedies of magicians too too. Let's remember also that "magicians" are same "priests", but in a protochaldaic transcription. "Magicians by profession existed, beginning from the most ancient civilization steps known to us. They lived the of koldovstvoohm also supported faith in him".3 Mentions of magicians and mediums contain not only in religious myths and canons, not only in secular chronicles and chronicles, but also in the literature applying for scientific character or at a certain "critical look". As we remember, "spiritism", "mesmerizm", "dukhovideniye", popular in the nineteenth century, were not always perceived with trust. "Magicians", "spiritists", "stolovrashchatel" on their sessions were torturedсь to check and control.4 At first sight it seems that almost all these certificates, both critical, and enthusiastic to us it is necessary to ignore equally as before the beginning of the 20th century the due level of objectivity was not provided to checks. "Early experiments resembled rather saloon games, than on serious scientific research.".5 Partly, it of course, so, but sometimes, for assessment of abilities of the famous mediums and then very significant scientific forces were mobilized. Their conclusions cannot be rejected with reference to their archaism and not absolutely correct recording of experiments. Example of they are trials on which the commission as a part of I. F. Tsion, Butlerov, Ovsyannikov, Aksakov, Petrushevsky, in 1871 at University of St. Petersburg put Dan-Douglas Yum. I will remind that in the second pto the olovena of the nineteenth century of Yum6 was a spiritualistic star of the first magnitude. Journalists, musicians, kings, writers, scientists, bewitched

diplomats and ladies ease and persuasiveness of its relationship with spirits. Its sessions looked shocking and it is extremely convincing. They did not leave at the audience and participants any doubts that thanks to unique abilities of the medium before them there is a real contact with ghosts that "soul" becomes evidence. "There are many descriptions of how Yum established connection with forces of the other world, but the physical phenomena or manifestations of spirits opening fantastic abilities Yuma, were the best evidence of existence at it supernatural force.".1 This contact it is difficult to experience delight and "ecstasy" today, but then there was strong conviction, that what for centuries prophets, theologians and philosophers on sessions Yuma spoke about obtained, at last, the obvious evidence. In addition Yum was not bad teacher as it восfed a spiritist Elena Blavatskaya,2 having made the assistant of a fokusnitsa of the Istanbul circus. As confirmation of huge and absolutely real power which this character over contemporaries had serves the following fact: when one of the richest widows of England, to Mrs. J. Lyon spirit it the late husband on a spiritualistic session Yuma "enjoined" to adopt the magician, that without everyones to Cocabath agreed to make it.3 After death Yuma in its things the harmonicas made by request were found midget …. Posthumous inspection of a body of dukhovidets did not record anything remarkable, except extremely peculiar designs of his magnificent moustaches. They were skillfully trimmed from within, leaving a cavity in which the tiny lip garmoshechka precisely was located under the hair massif. On Daniel Douglas Yum's sessions as we know, strange and magic melodies periodically sounded "from nowhere". However, perhaps, "meeting" of these three factors4 was mere coincidence. The procession of the medium along Europe was triumphal … prior to a meeting with the peterurgsky physiologist Ilya Faddeevich Tsion, the teacher of I. P. Pavlov who became the administrator of the St. Petersburg commission on "establishment of a dopodlinnost of the happening contacts with other world". In the commission,5 generally there were supporters and admirers Yuma. In particular, the great chemist A. M. Butlerov was that. still professor A. N. Aksakov, the most authoritative researcher of spiritism in Russia was one adherent of "the friend of spirits". Cyanogen6 positioned itself as the person strictly neutral, ready to accept any result if it is it is confirmed experimentally. Perhaps, Ilya Faddeevich, as brilliant scientist, established at once that the handsome magician is not going to share with him the fees, that is for the Russian science it is useless. Anyway, but the organization of work of the commission, selection of the room, arrangement of stock and so forth was entrusted Tsion. On March 10, 1871, at 21:30 in the evening the meeting of the commission took place in one of premises of physical faculty. The room was aired, well lit, in the middle of it stood table, covered green cloth. Before the beginning of an experiment Ilya Faddeich respectfully asked the magician a question: – Whether "The table design is an essential factor?"

Having received the answer that "it has in general no value", Tsion removed cloth. Here also it became clear that the wooden deaf table-top traditional for spiritualistic sessions was replaced with glass. Completely transparent. The space under a table was very brightly lit. Legs of all participants of an experiment were well visible. And here the embarrassment began. The sublime handsome Yum, the friend of spirits and the master of ghosts could not show the university commission a uniform sample of the extraordinary art. Remained the table is not mobile. Spirits were silent and for some reason did not make mysterious touches to legs and cheeks of experimenters. Юм sparkled eyes, concentrated, very expressively was silent, but achieved only increase of own pulse what drew the attention of the commission to. Butlerov, Aksakov and the mathematician Chebyshev it is lost kept silent, and Ilya Faddeich created on the person expression of immense sympathy. Soon Yum tried to convince attendees that "somewhere in a table" weak sounds are distributed. The commission could not agree with this statement. In her opinion, the table kept silence. Then the magician reported about emergence of certain air streams. Ilya Faddeich on it politely reported that at his request opened a fan pipe. The session lasted nearly two hours, but events more essential, than increase of pulse and opening of a pipe did not happen. Butlerov and Aksakov were embarrassed. Tsion was insufferably polite. The magician's failure was explained, certainly, not with transparency of a table-top and bright illumination of subcapital space, and it is exclusive the fact that the physiologist Tsion, the rough scepticism created "intolerable conditions for the thin phenomena". Aksakov biliously declared that "actions of the commission have nothing in common with a scientific experiment" and called an event misunderstanding. He was completely supported by A. M. Butlerov, N. P. Wagner and many others scientists. It is remarkable that the failure on "the tsionovsky commission" in general did not affect the general success of the St. Petersburg tours of Dan Douglas Yum in any way. On sessions everything was, as always and everywhere. Ladies from delight fainted, and letters wrote then Yuma. History kept them. It is important that some of their part contains secret dreams of ladies, namely: to throw the grown hateful light and to follow submissively "the friend of spirits". Their husbands, the highest ranks Russian andmperiya1 on sessions shook epaulets and in spiritual ecstasy got eyes under a forehead. Poets turned pale and were overflowed with inspiration. Educated the merchants were once again convinced that "grave" it only door to other world. Success Yuma in Russia was full. As, however and in Austria, Germany, France or Italy. Tsion's experiment could not lower degree of an enthusiastic isterizm of public even on a thousand share. To Ilya Faddeevich at once припomnit its reputation of "butcher"2 its conflicts with students, its Jewish origin and some levity in religious questions. Moreover, Tsion was it is accused in "materialistic charlatanism" and full inability to see something, beyond "primitive physiology".

Why we reviewed this example, having ignored reports and protocols, where scientists not less known, than Tsion, confirmed purity of methods Yuma, reality of his contact with spirits? Only because in all other cases the terms of carrying out an experiment were dictated and defined by the magician, and in the case considered by us techniques of an objective experiment for the first time were applied. They still were not strict in a due measure, but the first recorded "failure" of a spiritist as a result followed. Evzapiya Palladino1 was other superstar of spiritism. Evzapiya, as well as Yum, made grandiose success both in Europe, and in America. Various commissions including very authoritative, one by one recognized authenticity it abilities. The triumph was a little it is saddened that in 1895 group of the Cambridge professors – sceptics which entered, F. Myers, and also R. Hodgson who was then secretary "The American Society of mental researches" convicted Evzapiya of use of very rough tricks. However, supporters of a mediumizm accused the Cambridge commission of excessive skepticalness and besides "of creation of conditions, intolerable for disclosure of so thin gift". As well as in the history with Yum, the unpleasant precedent in Cambridge did not affect reputation of the clairvoyant in any way. The public continued Evzapiya's worship, and it opponents were simply ignored, as well as the guarding detail of the biography of a spiritessa: she long enough was a wife and the assistant to very famous circus conjurer. All points over "i" were this time placed not in Russia, and in America where Evzapiya had to deal again with tough sceptics. On this time as a part of the commission there were professors – physicists Robert Wood and Ogastes Traubridzh, the physiologist Gugo Murstenburg and the doctor J. D. Kuekenbos. Highly experienced professor Murstenburg did not begin "to consider spiritual nuances" or to spend time on calculations those millimeters and centimeters on which magic energy of Palladino was capable to move tables and chairs. It arrived differently. Мурстенбург disposed to place under a table at which there was a control session, the assistant. Certainly, the last crept there imperceptibly when participants already seated when the light was turned off and objects which the spirits caused by Evzapiya were necessary to move are placed. The situation avariciously, but is expressively described in notes of Murstenburga: "We held Evzapiya by wrists, we felt both it foot, and still the table which was behind it, moved. We felt that it rises up. But here the deafening cry was distributed. I did not hear such shout even in tragic scenes of Sara Bernhardt. Evzapiya shouted so, as if it pricked a knife. What has happened? She did not expect that on a floor my assistant who was attentively observing for lies it legs. He saw that Palladino dexterously released a leg from a shoe, some inconceivable movement stretched it back also began to rummage it behind herself. Then he grabbed it for a heel, and she terribly cried, having thought, that got".2 Perhaps, will seem remarkable that the passionate apologist and the preacher spiritualizm A.

of Evzapiya Palladino hid, without having mentioned it anywhere and in any way. Possibly, this fact hurt sir Artur who deserved for the fanaticism a nickname in the press "Saint Pavel of spiritism". Let's note that we not incidentally undertook to consider only"superstars" spiritism. Their abilities were confirmed by the most authoritative scientists and writers of that time. I will remind that among admirers Yuma and Palladino were: K. Flamarion, A. Conan-Doyle, Sedgwick, A. Butlerov, U. Kruks, O. Lodge, Ch. Lambrozo, Sh. Richet, Skiaparelli et cetera. Even proceeding from two of these cases we can assume reasonably that control the medium sessions, perhaps, there were not the place "contacts of souls of the died people with the world live", and it is rather a competition in cunning. At all desire, it is difficult to find in controlled sessions though something inexplicable. It is rather on the contrary. We see deception and an embarrassment. The motivation of deception is clear. If he was successful, then the stolovrashchatel increased the glory and could increaseь sizes of the fees for sessions.1 If won scientists – then they managed to become famous and provide to the exposing publications circulations and popularity, i.e. and here with motivation more and more or less clear. Seemingly so banal reason is badly completed with grandness names unmaskers. But! These are names of Faraday today, professor Tarkhanov, Shevrel, Murstenburga, Hodgson, Geksli, Sikorsky, Carpenter and other sceptics sound so majestically and axiomatically. And there was time when each of the heroes of science listed by us was very and is very anxious, both enhancement of the glory, and the sizes of the fees for lectures, publications and performances. It is quite possible that, sometimes scientists only "the pure passion" to a dethronement of what they sincerely considered fraud directed. Such precedents, for certain, were, just they remained to nobody known. They are unknown and to us. Even sample of all unselfishness, Dmitry Ivanovich Mendeleyev acting as seemed for "pure love to science and light of knowledge", founded the well-known "commission of unmaskers" first of all to discredit the old rival A. Butlerov who was "the patron of spiritists". From outside, certainly, everything looked very adequately. Allegedly, having found out that the spiritism has very strong patrons in scientific the world, Mendeleyev decided that "Against the professorial authority it was necessary to work professorial" He managed to organize at SPB University special group which, it seems, was engaged in revelations of mediums, spiritists and пр., and actually derided and made out a fool Butlerov. Dmitry Ivanovich wrote: "Occupations a stolovercheniye, a conversation with invisible beings and so forth threaten with distribution of the mysticism able to tear off many from a healthy view of objects and to strengthen superstitions." From "Mendeleyev's proposals to Physical society at the St. Petersburg university about establishment of the commission for consideration of the phenomena called by mediumichesky» SPB 1875. The Mendeleevsky commission, having worked only a year, certainly, rendered a verdict: "The spiritualistic phenomena come from unconscious movements or from conscious deception".

History of spiritism is not representable without Kate, Li and Margaret Fox. They created a cult of clairvoyance and a magizm in America, having fascinated public and having generated thousands of imitators. Having conquered the States, sisters undertook a voyage worldwide, triumphally addressing monarchs, diplomats and professors. They passed a hearth of tens scientists the commissions which unsuccessfully tried to expose them. Their glory was faultless, and influence is huge. But … one fine day Margarita Fox sat down and wrote recognition. The girl from amazing scrupulousness described spiritualistic feats of all three sisters. it the description did not leave any doubts, that everything, than Fox blew the mind of public and scientists was a mystification and fraud. Margarita Fox's recognition was voluntary, documented and published to "New York уорлд" of October 21, 1888. According to other data Margaret in the same day acted with a self-exposing session in the hall of the New York academy of music. Moreover, after the publication Magarita made still one America tour, but already for accusation of spiritism. But it, let and eloquent, but nevertheless, isolated case. It too not gives the bases for final conclusions as after a while Margarita Fox very hysterically disproved the self-exposure.1 It is remarkable that the sense reported by spirits, as a rule, was not analyzed. The fact of a possibility of the introduction in negotiations with "other world", but style and the maintenance of those remarks was denied or accepted that was given by spirits, it was almost not discussed. For the first time the psychiatrist I. A. Sikorsky who noticed that "the fact that managed to report to spiritists spirits, is absolutely mediocre or insignificant" paid attention to this party of a question. U. Carpenter in the трto Uda of "Mind physiology basis"2 noted that the otherworldly statements heard by participants of sessions "are an example of the most trite and empty chatter". Characterizing messages from other world, E. Taylor spoke still more precisely: "The warehouse of thoughts, language and a pronunciation happen always sootvetstvenna to intellectual qualities of the medium." He also noted full senselessness of messages even if they sounded on behalf of the caused "spirit" "the philosopher, the moralist or the great statesman". This important observation speaking very much about much. But still more important what none of the caused spirits were never capable to tell or write on the native language. Inhabitants of the most ancient eras, Assyrians, Phoenicians, ancient Hindus, Greeks and Romans, lips of the spiritists who caused them, always spoke only language of the spiritist and on any the friend. The conflict between Harry Gudini and his close friend Artur Conan-Doyle is the most drama example of this strange property of spirits. How everything was? The spouse A. Conan-Doyle who was considered as very strong medium carried out especially for Gudini, missing the died mother a session of spiritualistic communication with it. "Were convinced by Doyli that the contact was successful, but Gudini was only terrified to obvious deception. So, during Mrs. Doyle's session as the medium, received, the long letter written

in English from Gudini's mother. But Gudini perfectly knew what his mother knew only German and a little Hungarian … Doyli tried to justify themselves, but Harry Gudini раzorvat with them any relations".1 Possibly, under the influence of this history of Gudini also began "hunting" for spiritists, psychics, mediums and healers. Knowing practically all arsenal of an illusionism, he easily exposed any paranormal phenomena, proving that this or that effect of "dukhoprisutstviye" speaks technical or manupulyativny receptions, хорошо known to professionals.2 Authority of the brilliant conjurer,"devoted in everything", Gudini multiplied by ruthlessness "to charlatans" it is strong "spoiled a physiognomy" to a spiritualizm. Its revelations of dukhovidets were so terrible that even in very unctuous "History" of Doyle there was a town for poisonous lines about the former friend: "It is hard to say what is more unpleasant: the conjurer Gudini with his absurd are also ignorantми theories about swindlers or …".3 However, history happened to Gudini a bit later, almost under the curtain of an era of spiritists when according to official statistics, supporters of this doctrine there were no more than five million people in the world. And at the beginning of the XX century mediums did not give up. They with surprising readiness went for tests, offering themselves to the most evil and ironic commissions. Only through mendeleevsky "inquisition" there passed almost all celebrities of a mediumizm: Kleier, Petty's brothers, Bredif and so forth. Dmitry Ivanovich is that is called skillful "to have a heart-to-heart talk", and Petty's tests ended4 sobbings of brothers. Elena Blavatskaya was exposed three times. And, each of revelations was terrible and unambiguous. For the first time it happened when the white hand of the ghost arising "from nowhere" on its evenings, it was the usual glove which is carefully filled by cotton wool and umashchenny phosphorus. Scandal was so strong that the French Spiritualistic Society which she at that time headed was forced to self-destruct. For the second time the incorporeal "spirit mentor" arising at the most dramatic situation of a session was grabbed and detained. It was it circus actor, with which Elena Petrovna was connected by old friendship from those times, when she worked in the Istanbul circus. The third case was still more unpleasantly. The faithful adherent and Blavatskaya's supporter A. Sinett recognized presence of special personnel which at the right time dumped "notes from the Tibetan teachers" on a spiritualistic table. However, series of failures did not prevent authoritative supporters of a spiritualizm to write about it enthusiastic works in any way. In Russia professor A. Aksakov who somehow managed in the work "was engaged in it, in particularMonument to scientific prejudice»5 all failures of mediums on "the mendeleevsky commissions" to present them brilliant achievements, and their – sufferers.

Blavatskaya, despite scandals, managed to become a banner and the official ideologist of magicians of the present, to get army of fans, to write and publish a set of works which are republished and studied to this day. Also the general world ideological providing a cult of a dukhovideniye was extremely powerful. It is known1 about one thousand fundamental works approving the validity of a spiritualizm. The most famous philosophers, psychiatrists, psychologists, chemists, anthropologists, politicians, outstanding inventors were their authors, scientists – Nobel Prize laureates and writers. In this list Arthur Conan-Doyle, J. Arthur Hill, Fenimore Cooper, K. Flamarion, Hugo, Svedenborg, Schopenhauer, Beecher-Stou, and even opener of thallium sir U. Kruks. Any owners of scepters of Europe of togasabout time too2 plaid about magic sessions. They, certainly, did not rotate tables, but gently patronized mediums. Distribution and popularity of spiritism were promoted by almost all royal houses, grand dukes of House of Romanovs, presidents and ministers. To spirits Lincoln, Franklin, Gladston, Madzini, Garibaldi, Franz Joseph addressed for council. In St. Petersburg of the end of the XIX beginning of the 20th centuries the prince Oldenburg was passionate and very influential preacher of a spiritualizm. It is necessary to remember that it was that person that based, built and long supported Institute of Experimental Medicine, academic institution with faultless scientific reputation. Oldenburg, however, it was well-known not only spiritualistic hobbies and charity. He also made experiments, wishing to enter the name in history of medicine not only as patron. In particular, the prince developed a technique of disposal of sharp pains by means of installation of legs of the patient on the working street organ. Sharmanthe vibrations and sounds3 reported the necessary speed to electric waves in the sufferer's body which stagnation caused feelings of pain. In commitment to spiritism the prince was unshakable, generous and brave. His belief in a celebration of mediums was so strong that once he suggested "to be convinced personally" and "at last, to believe in life spirits" … to the mocker and skeptic I. P. Pavlov. Pavlov4 attended a spiritualistic session in the Anichkov Palace and without special work spoiled evening to the fans of sublime who gathered there. He made it simply – having provided complete physical control of all movements of the magician. This history gained fame, but the investigation it there was only an announcement5 «hopeless and the primitive materialist whose presence, served as spiritual counteraction to opening of a gate of the secret world". Pavlov, in response to a remark about "spiritual counteraction", laughing, showed cuffs which to it were torn by the medium trying to unscrew in the dark wrists from tenacious hands of Ivan Petrovich.

Supporters of a mediumizm quickly learned to ignore any information, unpleasant for them, and since the beginning of the XX century they already furiously counterattack materialists, successfully winning information spaces. The baron Guddelshtube struck public, placing in the the spiritualistic magazine of the certificate on how it managed to cause spirit of Hippocrates who gave the unique recipe treatment of sharp rheumatism.1 There are extremely convincing autographs left during the spiritualistic sessions Julius Caesar, Octavian, Yuvenal, Abailard's spirit and so forth. In other words, that era offers a set of tragedies and comedies, but it is not enough facts. Penitential memoirs of Margarita, conclusions of the mendeleevsky commission, witty tricks of Tsion and Mursenburga, effective revelations Yuma and Blavatskaya are rather fiction "on spiritism", than laboratory material for a research. Nevertheless, and it gives rather turbid, but satisfactory image of an overall picture. In it the lie, focuses and forgeries dominates. Something actually mysterious or inexplicable, at all desire we in it do not see yet. Of course, in a picture very high percent "circus" components guards. Almost all outstanding, axiomatic spiritists, founders of the whole directions and societies who had world слAva, anyway appear2 connected with circus craft. It concerns not only спиритизма, but also mesmerichesky practician,3 prophetic dreams, clairvoyance and so forth. A certain relative order in fixing of results was it is induced only with at the end of the first third of the 20th century. Only then the mode of complete control of "magician" was developed and room, in which the session was held. Approximately in the same time "magizm" for convenience of classification and documenting was it is divided on the main directions: telepathy, clairvoyance, proskopiya, psychokinesis, spiritism, healing, mediumizm, spiritualizm etc. Then not too graceful terms designating participants of a session were finally approved: перципиент and inductor. Перципиент is a magician, telepathist, clairvoyant. The inductor is the one who is exposed to supernatural influence. So, in material which provides us the XX century we can productively look real facts, testifying pro or contra existence couple of normal phenomena and abilities. Let's reject any estimated or intuitive judgments, regardless of authoritativeness of their authors. Recognition of the person by the medium or conviction in its charlatanism will not be taken us into account too even if I. P. Pavlov or Hermann von Helmholtz's this opinion. Our task – to vyshchepit only the unconditional facts and to estimate their influence on a factual picture of thinking of the person. As examples – let's take the brightest, recognized and famous mediums psychics who had millions of admirers. 1. Margery Krendon,4 started the midiumichesky career in 1923 became famous for calling of the spirit called Walter.

Besides an effective fling of objects, remarks, contacts Walter was able to leave various prints on pieces of wax. Including fingers. Without special work, by the most elementary fingerprinting it was established that a part of prints belongs to Margery, and others – it entrustedat the person and the dentist F. Kalvell.1 It is unclear, on what Krendon counted, making focuses with wax. The dactyloscopy was already quite ordinary practice. In 1905, judging by the reference of Natur, Scotland Yard had a card file in 80 thousand fingerprints. Possibly, as other police services of the world had the, not smaller card files too. 2. Elisabeth Kyubler-Ross2 Swiss psychiatrist medium, танатолог, charming and very scientist lady. It in the 1980th years founded the spiritual and salutary center which was called as "A shelter of inconsolable widows". In this institution the ladies who lost husbands had an opportunity to enter with "posthumous entities" of the late spouses spiritualistic communication including very close. In spite of the fact that the died husbands were citizens of absolutely different countries, people of different age, views, provisions, statuses and ideas of hygiene in all ladies who passed through "deep mystical contact" with the long ago rested spouses the same vaginal infection was found. The police which paid attention to this mysterious fact soon found out that the role of a great number of husbands was played by the same mister. Namely – the authorized representative Kyubler-Ross, the circus actor Jay Berkhem who skillfully used the utter darkness which was an indispensable condition of sessions. Actually, Berkhem was also a carrier of a venereal disease. When he was caught, he explained that "the essence from the other world cloned его for a meeting materialization".3 3. Peter Popoff, the superpopular clairvoyant and the healer of the 80th was not a spiritist in traditional sense of this word, but in the public healings and sessions steadily used the force the "St. spirit" called by it. Popoff showed improbable awareness about diseases and names of the people absolutely unknown to it who for the first time came to its spiritual curing sessions. "Public prayers of Popoff were extraordinary exact and comprised names, medical diagnoses and other personal information obtained by him from St. spirit …" "It became clear that Popoff's wife before the beginning and during the session went on audience and easy started talking to patients and their relatives. Then, by means of the portable transmitter it told to the husband that it is necessary to speak about this or that patient. As a result Popoff announced to thousands struck admirers exact name, disease and address of the specific participant." It is exposed was by means of banal radio interception. Caught in deception claimed that "used a radio transmitter in addition to strength of mind Saint".4

All of them at different times discredited a mediumizm and extrasensory perception, offering the "mysterious" phenomena the simple and checked explanations. In particular, Danniger "read mind", "predicted future", used on objects "the look force". All these sacral actions known to us on stories of ancient magic, Danniger accompanied with the statements explaining that they are usual, rather simple tricks. It opened technology of clairvoyance, spiritism and telepathy before public, exposing as it was expressed,"couple normal fraud." Let's note that professionals – illusionists snatched on spiritists and psychics at the first opportunity. They also became "funeral team" of all these the practician. Let's remember that the most ambitious scientists the commissions, before inclusion of illusionists in them, as a rule, were never capable to find deception. Treating everything it is extraordinary seriously, academicians could not assume that it is necessary to look for not the superthin and incomprehensible phenomena, and cheerful, the cunning, polished for centuries draw. Illusionists saw and recognized him at once. Here it is worth remembering history of brothers Devenport whom the expert boards sometimes including more than forty professors of Harvard and Cambridge could not expose. Besides professors at sessions at Dion Busiko's house on Ridzhen Street there were also dozens of journalists who are carefully looking for a dirty trick and too not finding it. Brothers Devenport,to it is known from their biography,1 went to England that "to battle against materialism in its own den". They defiantly threw down a challenge to all British science – and almost won it. Skeptical"Deyli News" through clenched teeth noted that "The miracles shown by these clowns laid England on shovels". The Cambridge professorate sadly kept silent, newspapers needled, but could not find a rational explanation occurring on sessions nobody. Brothers Devenport, "struck materialism", exulted, gave victorious interviews and organized balls and receptions. And here on their trouble there was somebody John N. Masklayn. He was a professional, but little-known conjurer. Having collected sad professorate and journalists, Masklayn it is easy and easy repeated everything that so shook science and the press of England. And then publicly explained to the technician of these tricks. At the same time Masklayn modestly noticed that "it still very simple focuses to which to teach it undertakes anyone for few months". Exposure was so convincing and devastating that one of Devenportov recanted publicly: "I am today here, being one of founders of spiritism to expose it as an absolute lie from beginning to end as the emptiest of all superstitions …».2 The tragic element degree in this renunciation was so high and sincere that even poisonous "Daley News" in the editorial did without mock and "dancings on a grave". It was limited to a note of the following contents: "If brothers Devenport, having shown everything that was shown, would guess to tell – "watch how everything is simple", then they would achieve not only good luck and a shame, but also respect of England".

Passion with which conjurers poisoned mediums is not too clear to the third-party viewer, but has a simple explanation. The matter is that "clairvoyants", "telepathists", "healers", "dukhovidets" and "spiritualists", as a rule, used a standard set of those tricks that were invented in circuses. "The flying hands", "mysterious rises objects", "bendings of spoons and knives by force of thought", circulations on water, magic healings and solving of thoughts, the technician of a levitation and a chrevoveshchaniye practiced still Kratifen, Feodosiy, Euclide and Deofit is semimythical illusionists of Ancient Greece. Most likely, not they were inventors of focuses, but these names were kept by history. Certainly, they had Egyptian, Assyrian, Chinese and Indian predecessors, and focuses were ground and improved within several centuries before getting on the markets and to amphitheaters of Hellas. Ancient Roman Saturnalia ground illusory art and transferred it to fairs of early Europe. In the XVI-XVIII centuries art of focus was brought to perfection by George Sabelius, master Gonen, Jean Roylle, Josef Frelich, Ioann Bosko, Katterfeldo, Isaak Fauks, Dzhindzhell, Pelladino and still in at least three tens classics of a circus illusion.1 In the early Middle Ages technology of focus remains known only that who works at arenas, but in 1533 Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa publishes in Cologne the work"About occult philosophy", where the whole chapter is devoted to tricks. In 1771 Johann Christiaan Vigleb publishes book "About Natural Magic". In 1790 there is a work G. Halle "The revealed secrets of ancient magicians and magicians or magic powers of the nature, in advantage and amusement used». Even the most fluent acquaintance to history of a circus illusion is enough to be convinced that, including a spiritualizm, and also healers and psychics did not invent one and all religious cults uniform own focus but only they borrowed the repertoire numbers known still with times Kratifena and Deofita. Perhaps, this small set of clever and effective blendes are also that "trace of god". If this is so, then confuses the fact that "world mind", "the creator and the master of planets and plasmas" a century after a century uses the same doubtful naborchik of miracles spotted at fairs and in circuses. Possibly, we should recognize defeat: we honestly looked for god, and found sad микст from notations and focuses. Knowledge of mysteries of circus brings down a spiritualizm and extrasensory perception today, without giving up for us hopes to find in them "a sverkhjestvenny factor". But! If illusionists of "an evangelical century" would have labor union, mass media and that passion which inspired Bonachek or Gudini, we would probably have on one world religion less. Её the paranormal party would be identified as a set of repertoire tricks, it is ruthlessly exposed and mocked. And without it parables and Christ's notations would remain simple folklore which would never turn the head even to slaves and drivers of donkeys. Christianity not an exception. The same fate would be had also by any other form of magic remaining in the primordialny to form or issued in religion. We see amusing inversion.

Circus trick in combination with a laughter, light, a make-up and an aping remains the fact that it is, i.e. a usual trick. It in combination with a gloom, pathos and a subject of death becomes the proof of existence of secret spiritual powers of the world. The reason of such inversion is clear. For a brain with its very limited opportunities and according to "cut down" retseptoriky, Wednesday also cannot offer a big variety of activators. And function of the central nervous system is their constant search that, possibly and compels poor TsNS homo "wander around", using the same phenomena as irritants, absolutely different in sense. The fine explaining example of such inversions is double use of a bromidroz. Bromidroz, as we know, is the sweat stench caused by its natural bacterial decomposition. It is difficult, polysynthetic aroma which base is isovalerian toislota and products of a nitrification.1 Bromidroz can cause an emetic reflex when proceeds from the decaying sweat of legs, and can be object of admiration if it is exhaled by expensive grades of cheese. Let's note, as in that and in other case it will be the same smell. Its chemical origin and physiological perception will not differ in any way. With account that milk2 it is difficult modification of sweat, kept with it3 to biokhimichasky relationship, it is also decomposed4 the same as sweat, same groups of bacteria, in particular Nitrosomonas. But! Exhaled by dirty zaprevshy socks, footcloths, soles and toes, it causes rejection and includes protective reactions, and presented on crystal or porcelain, in the form of "limburger" or "Camembert" provokes delight and desire to slowly define scale of aromatic intonations. Having peered, we will find out that our examples with focuses or bromidrozy are not unique. All culture of homo is overflowed with inversions. It is hard to say, where exactly their concentration is stronger. It and in double perception of genitals, in the "tickling" language incidents, in funeral and legal rituals. The lady making orogenitalny contact without any fluctuations swallows of men's sperm. If the same liquid is given it in a glass to beef to ribs, we, undoubtedly, will be able to observe all power of an emetic reflex. Knights – Gottfried's crusaders of Bulyonsky were in the habit to be rubbed with the father's stake. They complained about a stench from excrements of soldiers and armourbearers. It gives the bases to think of unsteadiness of balance of unconditioned and conditioned reflexes and again brings us to the well-known experiment of Erofeyeva. But now we are interested absolutely another. Unfortunately, as we see, it is impossible to find "god's traces" or at least those "prints of his fingers" which would allow us to judge existence of a supernatural factor capable to influence processes of thinking in religions. Impossibility to accept seriously the paranormal party of cults, exempts us from trust and to their declarations. Possibly, magic and all it derivatives – all this too rough man-made matter. Because of vulgarity it origins it also cannot contain what we look for. But it does not mean that our search of "god" can be considered finished.

It is known that the magic has a sister. Metaphysics. It never fell to focuses and collecting copper coins from old women. She did not undertake to learn or explain, believing that the secrets put in foundation of the world are not measured by knowledge and are not changeable by a prayer. It with identical fastidiousness wrinkled a nose, beholding both religious focuses, and the smoking retorts. It did not burn down people and did not open secretly corpses in cellars. In most it name which is translated as "the fact that after physics" the claim for knowledge of final sense very comfortably was placed. It got this name absolutely in a random way, but very well characterized a claim of metaphysics to be out of everything, after everything, to everything and at the heart of everything. As a rule, fell in love with metaphysics all disappointed in it to the available sister. For intellectuals, beginning still with times Simplition, in metaphysics, but not in religion the explanation of magic of love, music, valor, rhymes, eclipses and great opening was. Behind any vital event there was it as a certain supersensual, intangible beginning of the world which is the original reason of "miracle" of thinking, art, belief and beauty of the nature. Её arguments that were stronger and more convincing that at all were never and in any way formulated. They remained are invisible and incorporeal. In difference from magic which acquired vulnerable phraseology and amusing attributes "the supermundane secret began lives" never clothed in any concrete words and images. Thanks to it it long remained impregnable for malignant gossip. Её illusoriness, of course, is charming, but we should "feel" a subject of our discussion somehow. In other words, some tangible characteristics of this secret are necessary though. Them, of course it is possible to look at Aristotle, but we have no task just to make laugh public. Other antique authors do not offer anything intelligible too. European adherents of metaphysics: Hegel – Heidegger – Gusserl, catching it eternally escaping essence, millions of words piled up at each other, very fancifully changed their order, but could not output any characteristic of this phenomenon. In search of formulations of its meanings to us remains obrato titsya to primitive thinking.1 The classical anthropology offers a set of its options, but we need absolutely primitive, telling to Levi-Bryul's language of "domagicheskiya" and "to logical" an example of thinking. The task seems impracticable, but it not so. Of course, crystal, not turbid magizm purity of representations is a huge rarity. It is useless to be looked for in the European or Asian mythology. Fortunately we have "a homeland of all and all" – Tropical Africa. Exactly there, in the 50th years of the 20th century Bohumil Olya at tribes Crewe and сенуфо the most ancient ideas of the person of the supernatural beginnings of the world were found. This find for anthropology is comparable on the importance with detection of ediakarsky fauna for biology.

Nevertheless, it remained1 almost unnoticed and definitely not estimated. But, thanks to it, we can understand how the understanding paranormal could look if it did not become object of priestly business. On representations Crewe there is "a potentiality which does not have an image and shape, the called Nionsva or Niyesva". It is completely abstract and inaccessible. The contact with it is impossible. But it Iit vlyatsya by the beginning and the end of the world.2 Tribe Senufo adheres to similar representations, but they have that abstract form which fills space, the earth and the person it is called Kulotiolo. It is omnipotent, deaf to entreaties too and is indifferent to the events on the earth, сенуфо remember it, on expression B. Olya, "it is silent or hints». The European metaphysics till sixtieth years of the XX century did not know about the African recipe "silence and hints", but in general followed it.3 We see not just amusing coincidence. "The supermundane mystery" of metaphysics really can exist only in the mode of a neobjyasnennost and a nesformulirovannost. it charm – in it full uncertainty, and it language – silence. Senufo understood it much better, than Hegel. Therefore their Kulotiolo considerably "metafizichny", than "world spirit" of Hegel. The hegelianism, of course, made the business, but generally Europe weaved webs of "the inexpressible supernatural beginning" long before replication of painful verbosity of Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel. Basic raw materials for it myriads of poetic trifles served, and also fleeting nuances and images of humanitarian culture. As a swallow's nest saliva, these kickshaws stuck together vidovam narcissism in a single whole.4 Very chaotically and carelessly, but Europeans nevertheless had an image of the certain world secret predominating over everything including over sciences. But little David of exact knowledge grew up. With times Galilei and Vezalius it began to turn the I will forgive, expressively looking to metaphysics directly in it the eyes shining unearthly light. Approximately since the XVI century eternal fight between it and science was started. Now it is hard to say who exactly put in metaphysics in a forehead the first, really painful stone. It could be Bruno, Levenguk, Svammerdam or Byuffon. Now it is difficult to establish it. Then the metaphysics got off with the cone and a short faint, but she did not even imagine that waits it in the near future. We not quite precisely know how the situation in calm of offices was, but the first public rape of this person was committed by Julien Offre de Lametri. However, as Golbakh quickly sat down next to it, rape can be characterized as group. Tired Encyclopaedists were replaced by Laplace and Lamarck. Having made the business, they gallantly gave way to crowd of physiologists. Those were not inclined to courtesy and pranks.

They did not shake laces of cuffs and did not trouble themselves empty compliments as their predecessors. Having close got acquainted with Claude Bernard, Ivan Sechenov, and also Byukhner, Vogt, Maleshot, Funky, Vundty and so forth, the metaphysics learned the real nightmare. In general, very many successfully outraged upon it. The metaphysics sobbed poems and symphonies, snapped Gro's cloths and Kant's small volumes. But the eighteenth and the next one and a half centuries were for it time of continuous horror and shame. Besides a series of public group rapes she had to endure also other executions. Её till it bleeds feathers Geksli and Taylor, and Darwin beat iskolol a cane. Saliva of the Pavlovsk doggies burned huge holes in it flickering copes, and Einstein directly to it scratched on a forehead E =mc2. In other words, gradually, but truly, efforts of physicists, chemists, physiologists, archeologists and geologists the metaphysics managed to be squeezed out practically from all intellectual space. Process was hard, but by the beginning of the 20th century a considerable part of the phenomena and events already received the simple and easily checked explanation. In laboratories nature riddles were one by one solved, and together with each solution also the part of "the world secret" perished. The dying metaphysics, escaping from acids and lancets, crept in initial layers of time, during an era of formation of the planet and origin of life on it. There it was also dug round, vindictively hissing that the secret of emergence live is never inaccessible to knowledge that and any definiteness in a question of an origin there is no life, was not and cannot be. In this gorlumovsky hissing the familiar motive is well heard about existence of certain "not physical properties" of our world. K. Sagan wrote: "the belief not only among theologians and philosophers, but also among many biologists remained that life is not reduced to laws of physics and chemistry that is still some vital force, entelekhiya, Tao, a manna, it also moves that living beings, inhales in them life. It was impossible to believe as if all complexity and beauty, exact compliance of a form and function in a live organism come down to a vzto imodeystviye of atoms and molecules.".1 Perhaps, in it there is some sense. Anyway, but we are obliged to check this version finally to resolve for ourselves an issue of the TsNS some disputable properties.

Till the XVII century theory самозарождlife eniye from the decaying organic chemistry2 seemed so obvious that did not demand any proofs. Under autogeneration practically all main creators of human intelligence, from Aristotle to Descartes managed "to subscribe".

Heraclitus Ephesius, Democritus, and Epicurus, nevertheless, there is a tradition to consider the basic it Aristotle's author. Let's obey1 traditions, as initial authorship all the same not определимо and not essentially. Let's note that autogeneration as the author's idea of Stagirit was interpreted and wandered on all late antique works, from Cicero to Lucretius and Plotinus. During an early Christian era Aristotelean "self-generation of worms, frogs and eels in the decaying meat, manure and ooze" was legalized by "fathers of church" – Basil of Caesarea, Avgustin Gipponsky, St Isidore of Seville. Later Thomas Aquinas and Albert von Bolstedt became apologists of autogeneration, and Aristotle was it is built in a rank praecursor Christi in rebus naturalibus.2 Humility with which the church accepted frankly pagan idea is very suspicious. However, history of "patristical" adoption of the idea of self-generation is absolutely not so simple as it seems today. Let's attentively consider literal quotes. In particular, St Isidore of Seville was the author of the following passage: "bees are formed of the decaying veal, cockroaches from horse meat, grasshoppers from m meatcatch, and scorpions – from crabs.",3 and Augustine Gipponsky: "Many very small animals, apparently, were not created for the fifth and sixth day, but came later, from the decaying matter". Foma Akvinskiya in the "Sum of theology"4 convinced that: "Even if there are new types, potentially they existed earlier that proves the fact that some animals are formed of rotting of other animals. It is easy to notice that these remarks are not quite coordinated with a bible picture of a mirotvoreniye where the author and the manufacturer of all life forms is exclusively god. Of course, in библthe Yeysk books there are fragmentik,5 which at very great desire can be interpreted as the evidence of education bees from a lion's corpse, and birds, field animals and fishes from "the earth and water", but addressing of fathers of church to so ambiguous verses is no more, than search of "a theological hole". In essence is a dangerous balancing on the verge of heresy, the conflict with the main sense of the bible legend. Similar вольности6 could cost much and To Vasily, and To Augustine, and To Isidor, and Foma, considering, that title of "fathers of church" and sacrality of the names they received posthumously. There is a question – for what creators of Christian ideology took this risk? Here two versions of the answer are possible. Versio I. In times бл.

Between force of antique knowledge and bible dogmas there was a competition. Honestly the church could not win in this fight, and the right is total to destroy scientists together with their works still had no.1 Of course, and at the time of early Christianity the church tried the forces in polemic with science. Already and then arguments of astronomers and mathematicians lost in persuasiveness to the main argument of Christians i.e. – "igni ferroque". We see it on an example2 physical Tsels and Porfiriya's elimination,3 Gipatiya's extermination, and истребlines of a set of antique books.4 As piety celebration sample over knowledge serves successful burning by the bishop Fefil in 391 of the Alexandria library; an instillation of books according to instructions of the devout emperor Valent; destruction "all books of the pre-Christian period, as offensive for Christians", made in 590 according to the order of the father Grigory the First. Of course, it was impressive, but nevertheless local progress. We recognize obvious: in the 5-7th centuries fundamental classics of science was still too hard churches. Why? First, because of a huge number of "lists" of Aristotle, Epicurus Christians had no et cetera which to exterminate of physical capacity. Secondly, in view of lack of any own distinct concept of an origin of life. Neither Augustine, nor at Isidor, nor at Vasily had no ideas of that how total will be the power of church, beginning since the 9th century. If they expected future opportunities of the organization, then probably and would not begin to use cunning and look for "loopholes" in bible texts. But Isidor, Augustine and Vasily, most likely, assumed that the competition to science can be long and dramatic. Being guided by reality, modern for them, the first church ideologists took clear precautionary measures, having made the formal peace with science and partly before it having inclined. If to recognize justice of our judgments, then everything falls into place and the mysterious eretizm of fathers of church receives an exhaustive explanation. So, that to give respectability and competitiveness to the child, the first creators of theology had "to pull" breeding and extremely provincial texts of the Bible on though some scientific framework. They could use in such quality only antique knowledge and therefore … sat down in a deep curtsey before Stagirit and his theory of self-generation, having put Aristotle above god and Moisey. In it there was small, but very constructive cunning which partly dismissed charges of wildness and provincialism from Christianity. Versio II. The second version will be heard a little fantastically, but we have no right to exclude it. It is quite possible that the open neglect bible meanings was caused not by an environment and not strategic reasons, but very ironic assessment of the universe "according to Moisey". Yes, names of St Isidore of Seville, Basil of Caesarea, бл. Augustine and Foma Akvinat became synonyms of limitation and fanaticism now. But!

We do not forget that time is a curve and muddy lens. Nobody can compete with it in ability to distort any fact and an image. Perhaps, actually these people were daredevils, already then supported knowledge, original Gnostics that weaved an uzoristy cloth of high theology for themselves and units similar, leaving to church masses bible primitivism. Let's note that fathers of church did not discuss autogeneration of more difficult beings. Danger of similar reflections was too big and obvious. The bible categorically left "copyright" of creation of the most part of fauna and the person only for god. Here holes for the ideologists of Christianity compelled a little "an otrikhtovaть" St. The writing under Aristotle1 did not remain. However, in it there was no special need also. Everything explaining in organic substances there was enough principle of autogeneration of life to build a satisfactory picture of creation of the world. it it was possible to use in researches, naturally, without passing those hidden lines that were designated in compositions of fathers of church, but holding it in mind, as a certain universal key to all riddles of an initial zhizneobrazovaniye. Let's note that search of empirical proofs of self-generation of organisms always seemed excessive. Bacons, Galilei, Copernicus, Guk, Kartezius, etc. accepted this idea without objections and operated with it as the certain "eternal truth". Certainly, almost without overstepping the limits designated by "fathers of church". Francis Bacon,2 in particular, as an example the cher described self-generationtopolokha in the earth, and Robert Hooke3 insisted on the same origin of all species of mushrooms and a mold. In the 16th century Теофраст Bombast von Gogencheim4 sharply violated "rules of the game", having extended the principle Generatio spontanea from the lowest life forms on the person. He wrote: "Take the known human liquid and leave it to decay in the sealed pumpkin, then in a horse stomach forty days, so far there not will begin to move, live and potter about that it is easy to notice. What turned out still is not similar to the person at all, but is transparent also without body. But if then it is careful, daily and with prudence to feed with human blood and to keep within forty weeks in constant and measured warmth of a horse stomach, then will occur the real live child, only very small"."De natura rerum». Today this passage of Paracelsus seems a sample of a boskhovsky fantastizm, generation gomunkulyarny dreams and frank obscurantism. But it today. In a year of the writing парацельсово the revelation was a standard of scientific character and free-thinking. Declaring a possibility of laboratory removal of "the little transparent man", Gogenkhaym not just broke border admissible for science, but also went in "frontal attack" on god. Gomunkulizm5 selected a prerogative of creation not only the lowest, but also highest life forms at a deity, thereby in general calling into question a role of supernatural force in the universe. Paracelsus paid for the liberty only with exile. Softness of this punishment has, certainly, the curious history, but it has not enough relation to the question discussed by us. However, the trick of the famous doctor and alchemist did not damage the concept of selfgeneration in any way. It continued to live, reign over minds and to form a basis of scientific outlook of that time.

By the 7th century the authority of the idea was so great that experiences of doctor Jean Batista Vangelmonta,1 which that did with propotely linen and wheat, were apprehended validly, but it is a little puzzled. Repeto, self-generation was represented by so indisputable scientific fact that empirical check of its validity looked an eccentricity. In what experiences Van Gelmonta, the physician who had excellent scientific reputation consisted, chemist, yes still and specialist in food of plants? Let's remind that the dear doctor filled clay pots the dirty, strongly pro-sweating shirts poured by grain wheat and in few weeks received in this substance of the "self-arisen" mice of both floors. Let's quote the doctor: "Because if you you will fill open jug lower linen, polluted then, having added wheat quantity there, approximately in twenty one days you will feel change of a smell as the ferment which was in linen gets through a wheaten peel and turns wheat into a mouse." Van Helmont J. B. Ortus medicinae.2 Success of an experiment was undoubted. Representation and science and theology about an origin of live organisms was confirmed by peep of eighteen cheerful little mice. If not this small triumph of the Dutch pedant, then it is possible, the old theory of Aristotle carefree would live still years fifty. But! The collapse of "the eternal truth of self-generation" also began with mice of doctor Van Gelmont. According to laws of development of science, Gelmont's success спровоtsirovat doctor Francesco Redi3 on a reciprocal experiment with rotten meat and flies. It is necessary to remember that Redi was a follower and the pupil of Garvey who was skeptical about "the eternal truth" very. Redi placed rotten snake meat in an open vessel and found there soon a great number of the self-arisen worms who were transformed to flies over time. On it it would be possible to calm down and take off a hat to little mice, Aristotle and St Isidore of Seville, but Redi4 was extremely pedantic doctor and decided to check own experiment for "purity". This time it took two vessels and having placed pieces of meat identical on pro-rottenness degree there, one of vessels tightened muslin, thereby having closed access to any insektusa there. Naturally, in the closed vessel "worms" did not samozaroditsya. Redi had suspicions that "the eternal truth" is not the indisputable scientific fact. He repeatedly repeated experiments, published their results, deserved glory of the subversive of bases and, certainly, was attacked by defenders of autogeneration. Soon the amusing dispute of two pedants expanded to scales of the all-European scientific discussion in which were involved such автoriteta as Marcello Malpighi,5 Antonis Van Levenguk,6 Jan Svammerdam,7 Pierre Gassendi.8

Levenguk scarified Redi, indulgently explaining from height of the greatness of "microscopist No. 1" that the format arising in the closed vessel of organisms was too small to be found without magic glasses. However, Levenguk's position did not differ distinctness and unambiguity. Most likely, it naturally changed under the influence of observations and reflections. In the the letter he wrote the London Royal society: "Watching surprising trade of the nature thanks to which there are these the "little animals" capable to live and continue the sort, we should be confused and ask a question, really to this day there are people who cling to old belief, as if living beings can arise as a result of rotting?" As we see, here Levenguk supports Redi, than his opponents rather. In other words, the main noise did the fact of participation of the great microscopist in a discussion, but not his changing position. The abbot Gassendi who was at that time one of masters of thoughts ardently declared stagiritovsky postulates on spontaneous origin of life in urine, manure, corpses, sweat, and then1 still also enriched the idea with reflections about autogeneration mechanics subtleties. In"De terrenis viventibus seu de animabilus" Gassendi in detail registered self-generation process, having added that these neogenic organisms receive soul from the remains of the soul which remained in that corpse which also generates them. Skeptical Svammerdam, the thinnest researcher of anatomy and physiology of insektus, publicly disproved Gassendi and Van-Gelmonta, having called the idea of autogeneration "foolish and not worthy even derisions".2 By the end of the XVII century the debate became more rigidly on a more substantial scale. The situation was diligent warmed up by Redi who exhausted arguments, but kept till an old age a gift to distinguished to mockeries at "samozarozhdenets". J. Needham,3 the prelate and the scientist, derided Svammerdam and Redi who rested by then, and then a series of experiments strengthened arguments of Gassendi and other supporters of autogeneration. It he deserved favorable Zh. L. L. Byuffon's assessment,4 which was on the side of generatio spontanea too. Byuffon, however, did not trouble himself any arguments, believing that greatness of his person automatically transfers any his beliefs to the category of the indisputable truth. In reply to Lazarro Spallanzani5 defiantly, beautifully and faultlessly evidential "processed" all arguments of supporters Needham, Gassendi and Van-Gelmonta, having explained the nature of their mistakes when experimenting. Smashing the theory of autogeneration, Spallantsani by the way, but very ironically touched also great Georges Louis Leklerk, having caused an attack of clear rage in the director of Royal Botanical Sadah. Needham, certainly, "scientifically flared up", i.e. Spallantsani declared "ignoramus" and "charlatan", and then answered with the whole series of the experiments confirming the correctness. John Grant in the автoritetny naukovedchesky work6 showed confidence, that "Needham resorted to a popular scientific method which it is always possible to correct almost any unpleasant situation: he swindled during the experiments".

figure. In the scientific world of that time it had a nickname L, Anguillard,1 received by it for passion at display of life of protozoa in the work "About it is newых microscopic opening".2 His long polemic war with Voltaire testifies to fighting character of Needham. In science history Needham entered thanks to the turned to Voltaire to the phrase: "By your words – the morals very insignificant subject also have to be subordinated to physics. I say that the physicist should subordinate to morals". Gradually the subject was heated more and stronger, and by the beginning of the 19th century Ge. B. Lamarck, Voltaire, F. Dujardin, F. Pushe, Ge. L. Gay-Lussac, Ge. Dumas, J. Tyndall, G. Bestian were involved in a discussion and still the great number of zoologists, chemists, physicists and biologists are less in "calibre". Samozarozhdentsa died in the last ditch, but TeoDore Shvann,3 and behind it and Louis Pasteur4 nevertheless put in a point in this dispute, having finally proved impossibility of selfemergence of live organisms in organic substrata. Pasteur wrote: "Nevermore doctrine of spontaneous origin will come in from mortal blow 5 …". The blow as it became clear later, deadly was not, but a series of pasterovsky experiences, phenomenal on the pedantry, nevertheless provided to opponents of generatio spontanea – a resolute victory. But, as soon as the victory over "the eternal truth" was won, there was a question, terrible for natural sciences: and how life arose? It was terrible the fact that it contained hint on inevitability of the certain supernatural force which once obviously interfered with process of the universe. Let's note an insight of the theologians, from the middle of the XIX century who were watching closely a fight between "the eternal truth" and scientific natural sciences. They were obviously amused by passion with which naturalists destroyed the idea of selfgeneration. Still before arrangement by Pasteur of "final points", mystics began to gloat over, foretelling that as a result of all experimental work the science will remove itself to recognition that creation of life was in power only to a nadprirodny being. Approximately it also occurred to the last third of the 19th century. For scientific freethinkers, the religious ideas which put so much work on defeat the victory over the principle of self-generation had very bitter taste. To complain there was nobody – the science to itself dug out this grave. After the crash of generatio spontanea it became clear that within many centuries this theory and was the "scientific", addressed to laws nature, but not to mysticism. Later it "deaths" there was a feeling that there is neither uniform "catch", nor a uniform thread which could lead to the rational and checked explanation of a phenomenon of emergence of life on the ancient earth.

No. 16
The possibility of an origin proved by Pasteur "live only from live" inevitably meant only one: the first link of all vital chain was powerful, high-organized, and allocated ability to infinite conscious transmutations initial organism. To give the chance to develop to all variety of organic life, it had to shatter itself(himself) into tens of thousands of absolutely different beginnings, give life to all types and "gather" back to supervise and direct development. Here really also began to smell god. And it what was not capable to generate any religious imagination. Never still for all history of mankind the reality of a deity was not such bright and convincing. The fact that Pasteur's god shown from test tubes, dephlegmators and evaporators had nothing in common with imaginations of cults was especially important. Cut out on curves of the highest metaphysics, he was "very taught" and is sterilely pure from priestly speculation. In works on science stories this moment is delicately characterized as "crisis of natural sciences". But it was more, than "crisis". It was crash. Publicly walked crowd of "subjective idealists", Hegelians, astrologers, metaphysicists, spiritists, vitalist and just religious fanatics over science. Uncountable Dostoyevsky – Avenariusa – V. Solovyov – Veysmana – De Frizi-Corzhinscie revenged natural sciences for years of humiliation of religious belief and the broken myths. The situation was extremely unpleasant. It was aggravated still and the fact that practically all opening of science were turned now against it most. Let's explain. The exact age of the planet, of course, was still it is not known. But! In the 17th century Newton's pupil Edmund determined by Galya him in 10.000 years. A bit later Georges Louis Leklerk de Buffon designated it for 74 thousand 832 years since that moment when the prominence which came off the Sun formed a planetary body of Earth. Lord Calvin in 1862 designated antiquity of our planet in forty million years. Sir Arthur Holmes in 1911 gave figure 1, 64 of one billion years. Ceretum, became soon clear that Earth is still more archaic education, than it having appearedлялось to Calvin and even Holmes.1 Presentation of more and more increasing figures provoked зabavny panic of estestvennik.2 By the beginning of the 20th century, today's3 figure of terrestrial age4 certainly, still did not sound. But already wagon trainthe picture of katarkheysky began5 eon and early Archean. Undoubtedly, – it was strictly mineral, oxygen-free, the high-temperature world, completely defenseless before the short-wave sunlight burning it. As it seemed, on the early earth there was no place for any life forms.

The last "nail in a coffin cover" of the estestvennichesky idea was hammered by geology of that time. Let's note that it was always a powerful and faithful ally of scientific free-thinking. Therefore it the certificate was apprehended most dramatically. The geology honestly executed the debt, stratifitsir and having concluded layers of crust that "the mass of gneiss, mica slate, phyllites etc. concern to archaean group, and those crystal slates which together with marble and quartzite lie on big extents under the most ancient breeds of cambrian system; still the remains of animals were not found in them or plants".1 Academic arch – "Science results" of t. II, p. 7012 fixes defeatist moods of naturalists of that time: "Undoubtedly, as all further attempts to find in depth of gneysovoslantsevy terrestrial armor any the remains related to us "hydrocarbonic" organisms are condemned on infertility". Ediakarskiye3 organisms are found still were not, but even them opening could only a little4 to move deep into time that line of demarcation that in consciousness scientists The 19th century divided"dead" and "live" Earth history eras. Situation, perhaps, knowledge of original age of biological life, that the first ekzoglifa, i.e. biogenous deposits, molecular minerals and the Archean contain in layers of the sedimentary breeds created during the sideyriysky period of the Proterozoic, i.e. 2,5 billion years ago, and the first cyanobacteria – in the breeds of the Paleoarchean Era formed 3.5 billion years ago could change partly. However, in order that in zetenokamenny layers of Barberton5 and Strelli-Pul6 to find traces of cyanobacteria, first of all exact knowledge of the fact that them was required it is necessary there to look for. And this knowledge could be based only on the powerful and demonstrable theory explaining inevitability of smooth and natural transition of matter from mineral and chemical in an organic state. The understanding that life is continuous chemical process, and its division on "was requireddead" and "live" the periods are no more than the misunderstanding imposed to science and blindly it swallowed. Such theory at the beginning of the century, certainly still did not exist. But! The one who should begin it to formulate, already tried on the grammar-school boy's peakcap. However, in 1900 future academician Oparin was only six years old and he was occupied more by fishing of crucians, than crisis of world natural sciences. To the second TVto orets of the theory of an abiogenesis, John Bieto rdon to Sanderson Haldane, it was at that time executed eight. Greatness of the Oxford walls in which he was born and grew, of course, already influenced him. He assisted the famous father physiologist John Scott Haldane, very much with enthusiasm washed test tubes and even considered in vitro alveoluses, but to the theory of an abiogenesis of his hand still "did not reach". Future The Nobel laureate Harold Clayton Ury who should prove experimentally fidelity of a part of the theory in 1900 noted the seventh anniversary, already having reputation of the poor

student and hooligan. Almost all its time was taken with listening of notations and the invention of ways of rescue from the next flogging. Sistematizator of the abiogenetichesky theory, the victorious academician John Desmond Bernal was only just conceived, and respectively, is awfully busy with passing of stages of an embryogenesis. Most likely, he met a turn of centuries still without peephole, at a tail and branchiate cracks. Its vital and scientific space was strictly limited to uterus walls so it could not affect drama events in any way in scientific world. And here professor Martin Gerard Rutten who should give to the theory fundamental geological proofs in 1900 even is conceived still was not. However, at least fifteen years had to pass also till the birth F. Shout, J. Watson, A. Kornberg, M. Eygen, M. Wilkins, M. Calvin, M. Peruts, De Duva – old definitions of "life" will allow to reject those Nobel laureates, whose works finally. Exactly thanks to them it became possible to expand essentially this concept and to recognize that any interatomic interaction already is "life", regardless of what is its result – simple chemical reactions or difficult organisms. Alias, for one reason or another all this magnificent company could not take part in battles between knowledge and metaphysics in any way. Meanwhile, advantage remained for mystics. They outnumbered estestvennik and unity. On their party there was a public ignorance, church, philosophy, psychology, literature, art and … the most part of sciences. In particular – physics, biology and geology.1 Certainly, in process of discovery of new values of age of the planet bible idea of creation of life was finally scattered in ashes. But,2 creationists, theologians and vitalist, had in a sleeve their metaphysical eternal card – certain supernatural intervention in planet history. Yes, it it was obvious not such as it is described by the Bible, but somewhere before the Cambrian, it, it is undoubted, it was carried out. It "a certain intervention" was very convenient argument. It was not disproved, not checked and unprovable. It there is nothing did not follow and did not conduct to anything. It was impossible neither to challenge it, nor to formulate. Of course, it was possible to laugh at it, it could be denied, but no other explanation of "lightning" change of full lifelessness of the Archean with cambrian abundance, except "intervention", then existed and never it seemed and will not appear. Pasteur's god perfectly approached for a role of the metaphysical creator of life. It is curious that here3 the traditional religious scheme of "execution of a prophecy" repeated. The phenomenon of such god as it appeared, was predicted. And not somebody, and Descartes. Kartezius has no short and distinct formulation of "prophecy", but here Pascale, more carefully other studied Descartes, managed it to remove: "I cannot forgive to Descartes of the following: in all philosophy it willingly managed without god, but could not keep not to give him click on a nose, having forced to set the world car in motion. And after that it good luck had no already more any affairs" Pascal. Pensees. Paris 1852, p. 41.

A bit later god having remote similarity with "cartesian пастеровским", was still time, having come up already from the quantum theory. However, and its century was not long. Caustic intellectual environment 30-The 60th years of the XX century dissolved also this god. What do we mean? I will remind. The image of "Schrödinger's cat" "got out" far beyond physics, having become a fashionable verbal toy. At the same time it is difficult to imagine something more unsuccessful, than this "cat". Schrödinger very much wanted to create an image of relationship of quantum and "classical" realities, but it at it and it did not turn out. The deepest incorrectness of the image offered by Schrödinger forces to admit Hawking: "When I hear about Schrödinger's cat, my hand tries to keep step with a rifle". And it is not Ervin Rudolf Schrödinger. Its importance and authoritativeness out of any suspicions. Nevertheless, was beyond the power to create a satisfactory verbal image of a quantum paradoxicality even for it. Why? Partly this question is answered by other creator of new physics, Richard Feynman. In the work"KED – the strange theory of light and substance" he recognizes that we are doomed "to use usual words in unusual value". B. Bova writes: "evolution did not prepare us sufficiently for understanding of such things as quantum physics, a curvature of an existential continuum, it is even difficult to apprehend age of Earth, not to mention age of the Universe … Metaphors help, but it no more, than a crutch and in most cases they only emphasize limitation of our imagination". Kvantovik-biokhimik A. Saint-Dyerdi goes farther than Feynman and Bova. He almost gropes a question essence, noting that "apparently, something is not in our present warehouse of thinking very important, whole measurement without which it is impossible to find approach to these problems". In what business? About what "whole measurement" Saint-Dyerdyi speaks? Possibly, we have an answer to this question. The matter is that the attempt to describe the quantum phenomena by means of words, terms and images is similar to a molding from … mercury. It is impossible to mark the thinnest phenomena those words which suit for fairy tales about "Little Red Riding Hood", for poems or preskription. At us, perhaps, not bad language. It at the very least provides interhuman communications and any lovely nonsenses, like literature. But it is not capable of bigger. It is as impossible to explain other physical world with its help how to give a technical characteristic of "Boeing" using at the same time only low and grunting of parantrop, or to retell the Illiad, by means of only two letters of the alphabet. Those words that are rather suitable for the description of a macrocosm – are completely made senseless in quantum reality and cease to designate something in general. Adapting our very rough formulations for the superthin and obscure phenomena, we strongly lock from ourselves sense of these phenomena and we distort their essence. Yes, we have no other words and images. It is possible to catch, of course, at a straw of difficult terminology, but as shows experience, it is not capable to help out and.

It is necessary to take courage and to recognize that human language is painfully poor and is not developed. To make a claim to us there is nobody – we for nothing spent three thousand years, having a good time bows to the ground, poems and self-praise. Poverty and backwardness of language will become in the near future the main problem of science which will significantly limit it development. Why? The matter is that language establishes limits of understanding. What has no verbal designation – does not take also place in thinking.1 Of course, it is possible to try. But it is necessary to prepare in advance that the most part of meanings will die and the result will be so ridiculous as "Schrödinger's cat". Give let's sort this statement. Shredingerovskaya "drama in a box" means2 a certain essential contrast between "death" and "life". On it the metaphor is also built. Alas, "life" and "death" are the very primitive concepts suitable for the poem, but equal account nothing meaning in serious texts. The matter is that from the point of view of biology, and furthermore and chemistry, and physics, a dead cat is not dead. Or rather, it cannot be considered as a certain "lifeless object" in any way. If we try to measure biological and chemical activity in a "dead" cat, then we let's see a grandiose parade of life.3 In the late cat there is an education and reproduction of billions of new microorganisms and bacteria, metamorphoses of enzymes, amino acids, gases and elements come true. The cat is filled with surprising transmutations of substance of cages. It is similar to invisible heavy-duty to fireworks on it to organism scatter seized power: кадаверин, rolled, путресцин and staphylococcus. Matter is transformed and cheerfully attack each other neogenic gases, acids and bacterial colonies. And at the molecular and submolecular level a picture of "a dead cat" still more curiously. Some4 part of molecules and atoms is involved in a necrotic carnival of changes, but the main part remains stable and unperturbable. Same, as,5 in a cat, purring or trapping a mouse. In other words, we with very high probability can note that at approach of "dokhlost" at the quantum level in general nothing occurred. Since the level of chemical elements below, the fact of so-called "death" is apprehended with absolute indifference or simply "is not noticed". As we see, so-called "death" breaks only biological identity of a specific cat, but everything making it "microdetails", certainly, live, are well and wait for new trance of mutations.6 The drama is absent. Came true only still one metamorphosis of live matter. Such mtаморфоз every second occurs7 quadrillions. The matter is that biological and furthermore chemical and physical death is absolutely unattainable state. At least, we have no slightest opportunity to present probability of such event. And certainly, there are no chances to describe it.

It is especially offensive taking into account that quantum theories, most likely, are really capable to give superdeep and ultraprecise interpretations of almost all phenomena of the physical world, except gravitation. 2 In that number. 3 The necrosis, as we know, starts very picturesque biological processes. 4 Nichtozhno small. 5 Approximately. 6 It is unlikely they are fated to develop ever in a cat, perhaps they should become pumpkin, a cigarette or the prime minister's bald head. 7 Пabout the most modest calculations.

We have only our regular "low" of parantrop which by means of several sounds, gesticulation and a drama vypuchivaniye of eyes try to characterize work of a collider. The Shredingerovsky attempt to formulate quanta by means of this "low" led to grandiose confusion. With easy Ervin Rudolph's hands in quantum mechanics rushed words, words, images and verbal treatments. Slops of the human speech flooded incomprehensibility of the quantum world, having distorted, having mixed and having mixed. "Low" became deafening and many-voiced. As a result "cat" served as ferment for the shocking myth that a quantum object "comes to life" only at the time of observation of it. Moreover, "котовья" Schrödinger's imagination allowed to develop the whole theory which allowed to treat some facts very flatter for homo in the way. Arose conviction, that observation, in itself exerts impact and on a state, and on behavior of a quantum object. "The mankind is not in the center of the Universe any more, everything became much worse, it опредelyat the nature of this reality".1 Rates homo flew up to heaven. From a modest animal, allocated some ingenuity, it turned into the most important factor of the universe capable to influence the quantum world again, to distort or normalize it only one look and presence. W. K. Heisenberg went still further Schrödinger also declared that "quantum objects have no history before observation". Otprepariruyem this important remark. It for 85% consists of intellectual intoxication, quite explainable sharpness, beauty and mysterious meanings of quantum opening of the XX century. But into 25% it is put very much serious thought of magic influence of consciousness of the person. If this the idea was introduced by the theologian,2 it it would be possible to ignore as a standard mystical nonsense. But declared it3 Heisenberg, that makes an ignoration impossible. Possibly, we would not manage "in a forehead" to cope with this statement of Verner Karl Heisenberg, but, fortunately the physics, over the last 50 years got several important ponimaniye which save us from need to enter polemic with this great shadow. For us everything made time and development of science. Let's remind. "Kot" and a number of statements of Heisenberg, of course, became shock for contemporaries. But quickly there occurred sobering up. Fair bewilderment became the first trezvyashchy factor: In what way, without "leading and directing" observation homo the Universe arose, was created and built? How it did without it during, at least 14 billion years when the person was not trace and? Then arose still one artful question: And why so influential being how the person, by the time of opening of the quantum world was so undeveloped what was not capable even to describe the processes happening at the submolecular level? This scepticism significantly lowered degree of delights.

Then gradually the understanding came that the concept "small" and "big" exists only for the person who on an old neolytic habit strives to compare everything with personal dimension and opportunities of the simple retseptorika. For the universe is not present neither "small", nor "big". There are equal and equivalent physical quantities. The role of each of them is equally essential. Moreover, as we know, there is an omnipotent symmetry. It, of course, "flickering", but nevertheless symmetry that is well noticeable on the example of strong nuclear interaction, symmetry of molecules, crystals, organisms, and also theories of the field.1 But if symmetry exists, then there is no logical opportunity to stop on quantum "fineness". Yes, from the point of view of the person, this particle is small. But it, undoubtedly, consists from still smaller fragments. Those, in turn, are split up and divisible again too. And so to not representable infinity. I will explain. Ведь if there is a symmetry,2 and also such "superlarge" structures as galaxies, has to be it are opposed also "supersmall" in comparison with which bosons will seem elephants. For example, in 2004 the huge emptiness having in the diameter about one billion light years was found. It, undoubtedly, is the isolated space structure, about what speaks it temperature.3 It is clear, to what degree it, speaking our language, is not representable huge. And by rules of symmetry also the particle which "fineness" for us is also unimaginable, as well as "fineness" of above-mentioned "emptiness" has to be opposed to it. For it there is no designation either words, or concepts. And small opportunities of language establish, alas, and very narrow limits of understanding. On this simple example we see that quanta lost the status of "the last stop" of division of physical matter. Proceeding even from one it, it is incorrect to confer on them responsibility for development of the Universe, at least. There was a concept "dekogerentnost" a bit later. Without claims for artistry it tried to designate the relations of the subatomic particles living out of our habitual logic with logical and "law-abiding" objects of classical physics. This modest, imperfect, but very correct term finally buried both "cat", and an image of homo – "the master of quanta". Having recorded "collapse" of this lovely hypothesis, we come back I in the nineteenth century in the field of the first grandiose fight between natural sciences and metaphysics. Paradeoksalno, but on metaphysical4 the idea practically all largest opening of the 19th century directly or indirectly "worked". And first of all – Darwin theory. As we remember, the first reaction on it was very painful. The well-known faint of lady Brewster and the drama of the former captain of "Beagle" of R. Fitsroya became symbols of that sincere horror which had to be experienced educated to public at the first acquaintance to the theory of evolution. Distinguished the viktorianka Brewster fainting on the known debate in Oxford was returned, of course, to life. But sincere wound, caused it a thought about it sortstvo with animals, killed in

the lady1 "all human". At first it out of curiosity was given to the Hindu porter, and then ceased to go to the opera. Fitzroy, though felt personal guilty for "Origin of species", but on such extremes as Brewster, was was not capable. He just committed suicide. So2 public reaction looked. Hieratic priesthood of that time – bishops of Uilberfors, Manning, Uayzmen, and also the abbot Amar and scientists priests Gladston and Bergon decided to accept battle and to defend the dignity of the person humiliated with the theory of evolution. Fororba with "bestial philosophy"3 the whole "Academy" which collected under the was founded banners the most titled theologians and professors of England, Germany and France. "There came time when the church has to enter resolutely on fight against the movement menacing to destroy the remains of Christian belief in England" "These disgraceful doctrines find to themselves the only support in the most disgusting passions. Their father – pride, their mother – obscenity, their offsprings – revolutions. They come from hell and to hell come back, having captured with themselves all those who not shameitsyaitsya to be their herald".4 Professor Lyudgardt5 rendered a verdict – "The idea of creation belongs to religion and natural sciences there is nothing to do." It is hard to say who poisoned Darwin with big passion: priests or scientist world. Let's remind that against the evolutionary idea such titans of science as Layel, Virkhov, Agassis, Owen, Dzhems, Bozizzio, Sedgwick, Rem rose. The procession of these giants who are indulgently trampling down Darwinism, of course, was followed also by crowds of the scientific gnomes demanding "to expose the easy rider who got on a mask scientist».6 The press was connected. Newspapers and magazines summarized opinion of the academic world on the theory of evolution: "Extremely unreasonable hypothesis" full of "incorrect prerequisites, superficial researches and obfuscatory reasonings". Darwin was presented in the majority of publications as "the superficial and uneducated person offended on the world because of the disease". And then there was that, as had to happen. First fright passed also it became obvious that the Darwinism in itself does not represent any danger to religious belief and foundations of society. Yes, it partly contradicts literal understanding of the Pentateuch, but the literal treatment can and be offered as it was made once by fathers of church, having recognized generatio spontanea. Today we see a result: the theory evolution "is captured by the enemy". On it to tables citizens in cassocks, Freudians, creationists, occultists etc. comfortably walk. Catholic Vatican, in the special encyclic of the father Pius XII "is favorable to it Humani generis" recognized it possible correctness.7 Evolution is indulgently frayed on to cheeks orthodox fundamentalists, shamans, rabbis and psychics. Both for religions, and for metaphysics in Darwinism there is no problem any more.

It is swallowed, digested and it is included them in their "metabolism". It happened because the Darvinian theory taken out of a context of "five theories" is absolutely defenseless and helpless. Being only a small fragment of a grandiose picture, "having remained one", the theory can be easily built in in any including a metaphysical design. But it still not all. At the theory of evolution is and still one weak point doing it harmless to "god". As withoutconditional scientific reality, it1 homo does not flatter. Homo in reply revenges it for "attempt at the fine myth about the exclusiveness" indifference and global mistrust to Darwinism. It automatically means refusal reception theories of evolution in a circle of so-called "eternal cultural values" of mankind. As a result the Darwinism becomes a personal toy of several hundred biologists. Considering meekness of these of "tear-stained four-eyes", the theory from them is periodically taken away "to play" all who feel like it. In 2002 Scientific American was delivered brilliant and extremely honest article about an evolutionism –"15 answers to a nonsense of creationists": "When Charles Darwin offered the theory of evolution on the basis of natural selection 143 years ago, scientists that era apprehended it in bayonets. However numerous paleontologic certificates, achievements of genetics, zoology, molecular biology and other sciences as a result confirmed indisputability of evolution. Evolution won this fight everywhere, except public consciousness." The most surprising that it, having gained the world glory, remained absolutely unknown, having partly repeated destiny of the Theory of Relativity. About the fact it existence, it seems, know everything, but that. Hopes of the bishop Uorchestersky who, once became covered cold then on a debate between Geksli and Uilberfors came true: "Let's hope that it is a lie. But even if it and the truth, we will hope that it will not become widely known". Powerlessness of the Darwinism taken out of a context of "five theories" became completely obvious just now, but it was noticeable still during an era of the first great fight of metaphysics, cults and science. Yes, Darwin developed accurate to the logician of development of types, but he did not specify life "initial point". He could not explain either the development prime cause, or its seeming suddenness. Its theory only aggravated with the force and scientific faultlessness dramatic nature of a situation. Evidential and in detail живописуя variety and improbable adaptive force of organisms, their aspiration to exist, the theory perplexed stopped in response to a question of the reason full lack of life in the Archean and about it rapid emergence in the Cambrian. Darwin it is discouraged wrote: "Difficulty to find some suitable explanation for lack of powerful congestions layers, rich with minerals, below cambrian system after all it is very big … It is necessary to recognize this fact still inexplicable and to it it is possible to point fairly, how to a strong objection against the views protected here."

Of course, abundance of minerals of the Cambrian, already known in the end of XIX and the beginning of the 20th century, made a fascinating impression. Especially strong it was in contrast with zoological and botanical "emptiness" of Precambrian deposits. Then popular expression "cambrian explosion" was born. Let's note that splinters and a shock wave of this "explosion" were assumed entirely by rationalism. "Explosion", sweeping away and mutilating it, reopened the road most sophisticated to mystical and metaphysical imaginations about "the beginning of the world". Only in the seventies the 20th century the become cheerful science which already recovered from shock will sneer Van der Vlerk's lips: "cambrian abundance of remains demonstrates not explosion of life, and fashion for sinks and cuticles." Expression "explosion of life" will be estimated as misunderstanding, and from the academic heights M. Rutten will proclaim that "explosion of life at the beginning of the Cambrian is only explosion of minerals. Just during this period some groups of animals gained ability to allocate firm sinks which remain in a fossil look much a beamше, than soft tissues of animals".1 But it will occur, as we already noted, much later.

Very much not casually all fighting vanguard of materialists, almost all its fundamental forces adjoined the camp of "samozarozhdenets", even when that was finally crushed by Pasteur and Shvann's arguments. The best example – E. Gekkel. In the "Natural history of a mirotvoreniye", in part I2 he writes: "To deny spontaneous origin – it means to recognize a miracle, divine creation of life. Or life arises spontaneously on the basis of these or those regularities, or it is created by supernatural forces." Curious sample of materialistic despair is also the position of G. Bestian who "to the most death which followed in 1915 persisted in the belief in spontaneous origin".3 Except the theory of evolution, the first histologic developments also "worked" for the metaphysical idea. Discovery of properties living cell, made Mol, Shleyden, Purkinye and Shvann explained biological complexity of this microscopic basis of life. The absolute impossibility became obvious it casual emergence among heated Archean stones. This most obvious thing besides inevitably removed to a factor of "supernatural intervention". The metaphysics triumphed and celebrated a victory. However, singed and shot banners rationalism all still fluttered. Estestvenniki was not handed over the hopeless positions, expecting "reinforcements", hoping for a possibility of scientific knowledge of "the main mystery of the world". Them as could, Claude Bernard consoled, saying that: "Nabout actually mystery of the birth4 is no more dark, than all other mysteries of life, but also not less". Materialistic positions very sadly looked. Let's remember them.

At the very beginning of the 20th century of the head of the reading ladies the "kosmozoalny" version turned.1 According to it, microgerms of life were brought on the planet by meteorites from space. The public accepted this hypothesis very favourably. The possible inoplanetnost of the general origin of life podslashchat bitterness of "a monkey factor". However, kosmozoa,2 despite it support by Helmholtz, Thomson and Vernadsky, was, in principle, unprovable and not checked, i.e. was out of the academic science. It was very good only as a horizontal bar for intellectual gymnastics. Later panspermiyets will receive a gift in a look three meteorites. The first and the smallest will become "Murchison", blown up in 1969 over the Australian small village. This meteorite as it became clear, contained in the substance of 18 amino acids, and also traces of paraffin, phenols, alcohols and carbohydrates. From eighteen amino acids of Murchison at least five were identical that they contain in proteins. The second meteorite was much larger and more powerful than Murchison. It was specially adjusted on opponents of a hypothesis of a panspermia and always left the many kilometers smoking funnels after the hits. As you probably already understood, the speech goes about an opener of spatial structure of DNA, sir Francis Crick. That suddenly like the ideas of a panspermia and made several model riots in classical evolutionary biology. The astrophysicist Fred Hoil possessing not smaller, than Shout, destructive potential became the third meteorite. However, these three phenomena3 will occur later. If we continue survey of the broken-through and crumpled front line естесtvennik, we will see that Gaad,4 Quincke5 and TraUbe6 tried in the laboratory way to reproduce protozoa organisms and protoplasm. Allen7 and Pflyuger8 (one by one) did attempts of "front" synthesis of protein on the basis of overactive cyanic connections. In other "entrenchment" heroic Wilhelm Ostwald, and also the Scarf, Schultz, Rauber, Przhibram and Lehman looked for a key from the mystery of a zhiznezarozhdeniye in likening of crystals and organisms. All these attempts were not successful. Confusion of materialists was aggravated: "But, maybe, what is impossible in laboratory is made nevertheless in the nature? Perhaps, somewhere on the earth lifeless material after all пit revrashchatsya in living beings?".9 Let's note that the true composure in the estestvennichesky camp was kept only by Thomas Henry Geksli. Perhaps, he only did not "bow" to teleologic and creationistic "bullets", did not panic, and "whistling walked on an entrenchment crest", inspiring the courage rationalists. Geksli remarkably soberly estimated cambrian organisms which practically all scientist the world considered the "first" on the earth: "In view of the organization of these mollusks and cancroid and their very complex structure, seems to me, the considerable share of imagination is

required to see in them the first creations of the live world … I think, there is no opportunity to assume justice of the assumption that these forms and represent rudiments of organic life …" Let's note that now we speak about a zhiznezarozhdeniye, without concerning questions of emergence of "reason and thinking" and furthermore intelligence of the person. This subject, too, always was1 metaphysics trump, not less powerful, than origin of the first cage. Neither convergence, nor selection, nor any it was impossible to explain with other mechanisms of evolution why the being who during hundreds of thousands of years was falling short even of the level of normal weak-mindedness innezapno got outstanding2 mental abilities. In fact, emergence of intelligence was still one "explosion" which then did not have any explanation except metaphysical. The inventions of a wheel, constructions, some mechanisms, agriculture which happened several thousands years ago, and also radical streamlining of the public relations in packs homo it was called "neolytic revolution" and "one of the greatest secrets in development of humanity".3 As we remember, in the Darwin extremely imprudently wrote time: "My purpose – to show that between the person and the highest animals there is no fundamental difference in intellectual opportunities" and "distinction in mental capacities between the person and the highest animals, as if it was not big, of course, quantitative, but not qualitative". These fatal phrases served as the invitation "on spark" for hordes of psychologists, vitalist and other fans of lofty matters. They accepted it, became hollow in the evolutionary theory and with pleasure arranged in it model disorder, without mincing words any more and mocking at everything that came them to hand. "Press of senselessness and absurdity, napechatlyonny on a forehead of the universe … No form of the worst materialism fell to such low world view …" "If this is so, then the mankind has only one exit – to die from preciselyyou and loathing to".4 Were and still more picturesque statements, but, for respect for the academic style of our research, we nevertheless will lower them. Darwin mourned: "It is heavy to be hated in such degree as hate me". It is necessary to tell that Darwin for the reflections about mind of the person then met with the deserts as passed «Rubicon" unarmed. Any serious it could not support the sensational statements with arguments. The matter is that them still did not exist. It was just that situation when the idea was already born, and it proofs5 on light still did not appear. I will remind that such situation not a rarity in science. James Dalton in the time expressed features of atoms, but confirmation of his thoughts became possible only in hundred years. Huygens in the 17th century solved the wave nature of light, but could not provide convincing proofs. Of course, similar reprises on a subject of a brain and thinking were afforded still in the 18th century Lammetri and Golbakh. By the way, almost with impunity.

But, in difference from Darwin, at them as publicists, had "a license for hooliganism" and spoke on behalf of philosophy, but not the academic science. It is necessary to remember also terrible reputation of this couple. Prelates and professors, knowing that feathers of "two villains" are killing and instantly turn opponents into laughing-stocks, accurately declared naturalistic philosophy representatives "madmen", and everything abated. With Darvin everything was differently: one business – usonogy crayfish, bramblings and "other cockleshells", another – attempt on an inner sanctum, human dignity from positions of deep natural sciences. Darwin defamed long and ruthlessly. Damnations of church to which sir Charles had to listen, by the way, much more softly and more tactfully, than series of the hysterical sentences pronounced to Darwin by scientific community. Kliment Arkadyevich Timiryazev it is juicy pictured reaction scientists contemporaries of Darwin on its theory, as "mix of inconsiderate charges of charlatanism, illiteracy, poverty of intellect with sneers, mockery and damnations". Brain physiology which should place a part of points over i in a thinking origin question, still did not engage. In the middle of the 19th century I. M. Sechenov, Byukhner, Vogt, Maleshott dumbfounded public rigid the materialistic attack to "eternal values" then the physiology took a break, with an innocent look studying localization of functions in back and a brain and laws of nervous conductivity. However, over it ranks the clang of primykayemy bayonets was already heard: Santiago Ramón Cajal already created the neural theory, Sherrington designated unconditional and total domination of nervous system in any organism, Hyuling Jackson developed the great idea of Charles Bella saying that the integrating structure of a brain is its most ancient part. It were brilliant opening. Each of them accumulated in itself the proofs of the material nature of thinking which are saved up by physiology and entirely was based on them. These opening struck with magnificence, but "were not mounted" in uniform system yet. The physiology was waiting in the wings, a paradigm and the leader. Sherrington on whom so many hopes were laid, still did not "fall", but already began notable drift towards mysticism, Kakhal defiantly occupied the cozy town "near fight", and to Jackson's ideas to materialize in intellectual the lightning, needed the impudent thinker – the clinical physician and much more материалисtichesk elektrizovanny "field".1 Just at this time Ivan Petrovich already dealt with digestion physiology, for as got the Nobel Prize. The triumph finally convinced Pavlov of omnipotence of an experimental method and that with its help it is possible to open and explain any "riddle" of the person. As you remember, Pavlov and a question of "soul" solved almost at once, having derisively offered it "to take in hand": "Of course, it is necessary to understand it in such a way that Köhler the inveterate animist, he cannot reconcile in any way that this soul can be taken in hand, to take in laboratory, on doggies to explain laws it activity".2 Certainly, Pavlov was not the first experimenter in the history, but he possessed passion, hardness and an opportunity to make long-term system experiments of in vivo.

T. e. at that time, "to Penfild" they were still powerless. I. P. Pavlov Chosen works of p. 490.

Moreover, he had improbable scientific composure and was able "not to notice" so-called "ethical problems", only sometimes routinely mentioning that in its laboratory "many dozens of dogs are spent". That, experiment "master key" is how universal, it was known long ago, but Ivan Petrovich created the real cult of experience and built it in the absolute. Moreover, being guided by the thinnest "scientific hearing" he was able to observe progressiveness of the vivisections, never running forward and without "jumping" through stages which needed to be passed. He well learned the "Nobel lesson" and understood, how exactly it is necessary to ask an object of researches necessary "questions" how to listen attentively to those "answers", which an object transfers through "doggies" and, how and when it is necessary to make the following course. At observance of all these conditions the right answer on the most difficult question of physiology was almost inevitable. The essential role was played also by Pavlov's ability to abstain from any manifestations of "virtuosity in science" and a genialnichanye. Of course, and he sometimes was mistaken. But only when gave itself to carry away or was fond. It happened, but is rare. Generally it was strict and сверхъестeatsvenno it is attentive, developing in itself, on its expression, "clairvoyance of reality". He stubborn cut, sewed up, observed, again cut and put fistulas, having assigned himself the observer's part, always subordinated to the authority of an experiment. The amazing opening1 the principles of digestion claimed Pavlov in confidence that "key" of a system experiment with same ease, as a stomach, it is possible "to open" also a brain. Moreover, bequeathed Lametri, Golbakh, and also and Claude Bernard the thought that "the great mystery" of thinking has to have a simple physiological solution began to receive confirmation with very first, still shy experiments. Why Pavlov became Pavlov? What distinguished it from dozens of other brilliant physiologists? From Vvedensky, Virkhov, Fritcha, Gittsiga, Tsion? From the same Gedengayn in whose laboratory Ivan Petrovich deservel nickname "Russian canary"?2 Bed curtainsаю that Ivan Perovich pertinently3 to compare to a bat desmodontidae. I will remind that the desmodontida, thanks to infrared receptors perfectly sees large blood vessels under thickness of skin and sticks into them unmistakably, from the first sting getting access to blood. Approximately Ivan Pavlov had the same property also. In any live organism he saw, first of all, experimental material. His look, thanks to this strictly physiological thinking, easily pronitsat through scabs of myths and prejudices about life. He knew where and with what force it is necessary "to bite" to get precisely to a riddle of physiological function of an organism. Of course, for such "clairvoyance" huge knowledge and eksperimentatorsky opportunities are required. However, one it is not enough. As we already spoke, it is necessary to observe "subordination" strictly. According to it, the leading role always belongs to result of experience.

The researcher has a role subordinated. Put it – to obey an experiment, to submit to an experiment and never to introduce anything personal in interpretation of an experiment. Any "views", any beliefs. The "more obediently" it will be, the also the final result will be more impressive. But even it is not enough. For exclusive success in physiological science it is required and "the cold eye" is exclusive. What do we mean, entering this strange term? First of all, we speak about full, boundless freedom from all massif of human mythology, culture and belief. I will explain. The researcher has to be free from feeling that somewhere "the supermundane, supernatural factor" is behind the mental horizon of knowledge. If the extra physical, sverkhjestvenny factor exists, then drawing of an objective picture of work of TsNS – waste of time. Why? Because by the most nature this "factor" has to have an opportunity to influence everything in the universe. Including on consciousness and thinking of the person. But in that case conditioned and unconditioned reflexes turn into trinkets with which "someone" can begin to juggle on the whim. Let's add that this"someone" it is unknown, and its purposes are unknown. Recognition of an extra physical basis of the world turns work of a brain into simple biological service of essentially incomprehensible process. And to the scientist remains pathetic role of the trackman, fateful to monitor functioning of system which has a mysterious, omnipotent owner. Let's note still time that conviction available such "owner" is the base of all culture of homo. As we already know, "owner" has a set names, persons and dresses. Each religion dresses up and brushes it on fashion of the era. And here the metaphysics leaves it anonymous and absolutely naked. However, this nakedness does not assume existence of a tummy or a penis. Universal flesh of "owner" is made of constellations, fogs and arias. In such look he not only wins in grace, but also is easier integrated into culture of any century. Need to supply with its side curls Christ or Keltsatkoatl's feathers disappears. Whether we like it or not, but to define where the metaphysics comes to an end and the culture begins, it is categorically impossible. In fact, the metaphysics and culture are the two parties of one coin. They are inseparable. Accepting culture doctrines through them it is free or involuntarily accepts also mysterious "owner". In narrow-minded representation this owner – the original author of symphonies and poems. And only he does by one Mozart, and leaves another unknown "keyboard player". He is an author1 all that is nominated as "genius". Through this concept of people it is fed with belief in existence of the certain extra physical force operating the world. Bach or Byron's existence, their unusual, from the point of view of homo"endowments" there are the proof of "god" more powerful and convincing, than any compositions of Augustine or texts of the gospel.

If there are phenomena which are not explained with science, and to it "genius" belongs, then there are very also very reasonable doubts in the accuracy of a scientific picture of the world. Napoleon or Da Vinci's hands god seizes dead grasp in a universe blanket also pulls it on itself. Atheists fear this subject and bypass it as accurately, as "neurotheologians" theory of conditioned reflexes. Of course, it is possible to pretend further that such problem does not exist or "to forget" about it that it did not prevent to draw beautiful materialistic theories. But in any most harmonious theory any Beethoven easily pierces a hole the "ingenious" finger. It is very important to understand that culture and science not just certain multi-vector phenomena. No. They are doomed to be at enmity eternally, putting each other mutilations. The culture approves greatness, incomprehensibility and uniqueness of the person. And the science proves it ничтожность, izuchayemost and banality.1 The conflict is inevitable here as the realistic picture has nothing in common with the flatter myth which it is strong it is implanted through culture. The main problem is that god is necessary for culture. To a cultра is the main bastion of god.2 To go to frontal attack on this bastion senselessly.3 Through culture the metaphysical idea becomes superinfluential and subordinates to itself any outlook.4 "Genius" and closely related uniqueness of the personality which each homo surely extends also to the person becomes main "miracle" of the world. But inequality which does not have any rational explanation "on endowments" breaks any physiological calculations of Byukhner – Maleshotta – Vogt-Bernard-Pavlov. Poets, painters, composers become archangels of the metaphysical beginning. Fiery swords of their poems and symphonies easily cut with the seeming inexplicability of the origin "in noodles" any estestvennik. Remove god, and you will bring down all at once conviction the person in the exclusiveness. Remove exclusiveness of "personality", and you will be able easily to bring down god. Business even not that poor thing homo will be deserted. Its hereditary dementia which is so convenient for masking "belief" will lose all covers at once, and the culture is partly devaluated. Symphonies will turn into the fact that they are actually. I.e. in structured by centuries-old in the way tests and mistakes sets of sound irritants which force of influence is explained by simple ability to pick up that sequence and height of sounds which influences acoustical receptors and reflex chains most strongly and brightly. Open fight with culture is deadly to science. It is necessary to remember that the culture came the first, "made habitable human life space" and for a long time established the laws. Through wild traditions and ridiculous fictions it operates

behavior and thoughts of billions of homo. This is the powerful and omnipotent enemy of any exact knowledge. The culture does not forgive infringement of the doctrines. It is vindictive and vindictive.1 Also it is necessary to remember that everywhere are placed it watchtowers, scurry about everywhere it observers also march soldiers. Certainly, it does scientific diversions still more seductively, but it is necessary to make them with all possible accuracy. And by all means to observe masking. About a proigryshnost of any open conflict very delicately and foggy, but in fact Schrödinger truly wrote: "… science which representatives inspire each other the ideas in language, at best clear only to small group of close fellow travelers, such science by all means will come off from human culture. In the long term she is doomed to powerlessness and paralysis however many proceeded and as if this style for the elite, within these, isols stubborn was not maintainedrovanny groups, experts".2 What conclusion we from all aforesaid have to draw? Only one: the physiologist has to bring up in himself clever contempt for culture, indulgent understanding it decorative effects, and also it convention and falsehood. It is not difficult. For this purpose it is necessary to study and understand only the mechanism by means of which the person learned to create various products of slozhnonervny activity. And it is only chains of conditioned reflexes which each culture knits in own way. It is possible "to play" culture, but it never it is necessary to accept seriously. And authority it creators, i.e. thousands of writers, poets, painters, musicians and philosophers has to be benevolently, but firmly it is rejected as something absolutely insignificant and not having any relation to knowledge. It very hardly, but3 Pavlov was capable and on it. Fine example – its relation to the most monumental idol of world philosophy, to Georg Friedrich Wilhelm Hegel. As we know and we see, around Hegel's shadow it is still accepted to tiptoe only, constantly giving it zone bows. Respect for Hegel is a not discussed minimum. Even fleeting, even the most correct doubts in its greatness are inadmissible. And here Ivan Petrovich, having examined some works of Georg Friedrich Wilhelm, expressed firm conviction that "Hegel is intellectually defective person". "It is difficult to imagine, he that the person with normal mind could claim that the idea, spirit is primary, initial, and matter – secondary, derivative said. Moreover, Pavlov declared determination to reason correctness of the assumptions and asked for these purposes to get to him the detailed biography of Hegel." Judging by memoirs of the academician E. A. Asratyan, I. Pavlov even expressed desire to study the biography of the philosopher to understand, "at what stage of life and what accident" resulted, in his opinion, "tragic changes of mind" of the philosopher. "To meet his desire I brought to it from the house the copy of Kuno Fischer's book about Hegel. In several days he told that it is not that book which is necessary to it. "In it not life of Hegel with all characteristics of his personality, and emergence, development and essence ег is describedabout mad thoughts and ideas".4

It is easy to understand I. P. Pavlov's irritation, in Hegel's compositions he first of all saw the conclusions which are based on extremely primitive ideas of the discussed question. Pavlova was difficult to be understood how the adult sane person can, вторгшись to the area of one of the most difficult sciences and without having any independent ideas of this science, it is so pompous and to categorically propose the solution it main question. As we remember, clicks on noses of philosophers is a long tradition of physiology. Gloomy Claude Bernard wrote: "The experimental physiology has no need to address any philosophical system … Discoveries are made without the aid of philosophy. And theories are created too without it… Now the physiology became the exact science. It has to be exempted from philosophical and theological theories which were so long added to it … we are observers of the facts without any prejudiced systematic idea". The same Bernard in the notebook called Kant,reindeer lichen and Schelling "baby's dummies".1 A bit later also the researcher of physiology of the Universe spoke: "I it is convinced, that philosophers exerted harmful impact on development of a scientific thought, having transferred some fundamental concepts from area of experience where they were under our control in apriority empire … Philosophical prejudices prevent the correct interpretation of the facts even scientist with courageous thinking and a keen intuition". On the XIV Madrid congress the first speech of Pavlov about the principles of higher nervous activity was heard. "The Madrid speech of I. P. Pavlov in this sense represents an example of straightforwardness and courage of great scientist. He was not afraid safely to refuse useless appeals to mental which for many years did not give noticeable shift in studying furanizm of nervous activity.".2 This speech was only a prolog, the first approach to the theory of conditioned reflexes, but also on it it was clear that in the person of Pavlov, metaphysics it is necessary to deal with the tender, but ruthless and mighty enemy. In the Madrid speech it is already noticeable that Pavlov understands need of clarification of science about a brain from pollution, introduced in it psychology and philosophy. Approximately in the same time Pavlov accepts also a row rigid organizational decisions. It leaves with those pupils, "that stood on positions of interpretation of intellectual works from psychology positions".3 However, Pavlov needed time. And there is a lot of. In order that the theory of conditioned reflexes was issued, proved and would strike the blow to the basic principles of metaphysics, it was required still not less than ten years. Let's note that for expansions broad natural-science interpretation of thinking, the situation was extremely adverse. Besides triumph of spiritism and an occultism, Europe endured the second coming of Hegelian mysticism. Found in it answers to the questions, god of physiology of that time Charles Scott Sherrington cold noticed Pavlova: "Your conditioned reflexes will hardly make success because they smell of materialism in England".

At the end of the XIX century Siegmund1 Freud already began to formulate the purely fantasy, but extremely vlyatelny doctrine. Its force was2 in gloss of literary giving and in an extraordinary lestnost of a freydizm for mankind. From the point of view of the market of paramedical services this theory was faultless.3 Freydizm – it was that, in what needed the conceiving Europe, tired of humiliation by materialists of all values of mankind. From Freud people not without pleasure learned that their thinking has secret vicious mechanisms in the basis that it copes certain omnipotent "subconsciousness", and also "by forces unconscious". still one pleasant opening was the fact that all these mysterious processes give in to adjustment by means of so-called "psychoanalysis". Of course, now it is difficult to understand who also ps were more the author of the ideas "subconsciousness, unconscioushoanaliza" – Freud or that4 centner of cocaine which, since 1883, doctor Sigismund Shlomo swallowed, injected, rubbed in all the mucous, used nazalno, klizmalno and even in the form of eye drops. To suspect the person familiar with fundamentals of physiology of a brain of the invention of such imaginations as "subconsciousness" is extremely difficult. And Freud not just knew physiology, and knew well. And till the cocaine period wrote several not bad articles including for the medical encyclopedia of Notnagel. So, most likely, an original creator of a freydizm is after all not the doctor, but C17 H21 NO4.5 By the way, apparently, cocaine intoxication prevented Freud to notice that essential medical discovery which he incidentally made in 1884. Being influenced by the cocaine sent it for researches by Merk's factory in Darmstadt he tested its strong infusion on corneas of own eyes and found ability of cocainum to paralyze receptors including painful. A bit later opening was appropriated by Karl Koller who on the basis of muffled article of Freud in "Heitlersche Zentralblatt fur Terapie" who described the feelings entered in operational ophthalmology a way of cocaine anesthesia of a cornea and by that began "a new era" of eye medicine. This situation brought Freudand in long-term rage and6 detonated its complete separation with physiology and medicine. However, he never forgot about the fascinating force of scientific terminology and continued by it to juggle. Moreover, well understanding commercial weight scientists regalia, doctor Sigismund Shlomo eleven times was unsuccessfully nominated for the Nobel Prize. In essence, all its doctrine7 had no connection with the scientific knowledge which are available for it. Moreover, he repeatedly mentioned that "the best pupils it found among not physicians".8 The Nobel laureate Peter Medavar characterized a freydizm as "grandiose fraud of the XX century". But Medavar, blinded the academic fastidiousness, most likely, nevertheless was mistaken. There is nothing grandiose in Freud's doctrine.

Unfortunately, in it at all anything there is no worthy mention. But it is impossible to consider a freydizm and just blank space. It forever will remain an example of that how parascientific imagination can be more seductive for public and real science. Freud long caused fair irritation of biologists, physiologists and neurologists until time lowered it from science "three floors below" in different mass and entertaining genres, like esoterics and psychology. Besides a freydizm, spiritism, gelelyanstvo, ezoterik and vulgar Christianity1 on the intellectual market of Europe also all types east the mystic filtered. All this together, together with metaphysics formed very adverse background. Of course, it could not influence directly results of scientific research, but he created excess difficulties.2 Bloody revolution of the 17th year in Russia was very useful. Having been accepted3 to make "the new person", it strongly isolated Russia from all entertainments of Europe. All mystical tendencies gradually lost on it territories right to vote. Moreover, revolution4 concluded the alliance with it the main enemy – the academic science. The USSR is generous and consecutive it financed, having allowed Pavlov not to pay any attention to frivolity of society. Regardless of value judgment of the Bolshevism it is necessary to recognize it certainly a positive role in creation of due conditions for the Pavlovsk physiological school and a huge number of the experiments made by it, and through it and on development of essentially important, global parameters of exact knowledge. Pavlov, undoubtedly, had exclusive freedom of scientific search, provided eatat conditions of the revolutionary environment.5 But to charge-off interdependence of two questions of an origin of thinking which are strong coordinated between themselves and the general origin of life also Pavlov first could not. For success it needed relative too definiteness in a life origin question. The theory of conditioned reflexes is let and heavy-duty, but nevertheless "a control shot". It is very good for finishing illusions, but categorically is not suitable in order that on dark corners of the universe to smother mystical chimeras. In order that the blow by it was effective, the opponent has to be exhausted, bloodless and it is desirable is strong connected. In other words, someone had to throw prostrate metaphysics on knees before Ivan Petrovich. Pavlov understood that in opposition with a global "extra physical factor" the destiny not only physiology, physics, astronomy and biology, but also all sciences in general is decided. But so far he could watch a fight only. "It is impossible to close eyes to the fact that a touch of true, consecutive natural sciences to the last side of life not will manage without large misunderstanding and counteraction from those, which long since and habitually this area of natural phenomena was discussed from a different perspective and only this point of view was recognized unitynno-lawful in this case".6

Tootory not up to the end still lost influence. It is possible (and it is necessary) to despise society, but it is worth to remember about financial dependence of science on its whims and hobbies. 3 Tojoint stock company and all revolutions. 4 Пonimy that to it alone not to cope with metaphysics. 5 We see again that not the most esthetic events very well influence the science history course. We already spoke about an experiment of Fritcha-Gittsiga, but such examples in the history a set. Let's remember the English plague of 1665. Yes, several million people fell its victim. But it drove Newton into "The Lincolnshire asceticism" where he, having completely isolated from the world, at last found time to investigate dispersion of light and to begin the main work "Mathematical Beginnings of Natural Philosophy". 6 I.

Of course, we without effort could reconstruct a condition of a subject during the Pavlovsk era, but we will receive only museum piece, today absolutely not urgent. However, also those representations which could be summarized in 10–20 years of the XX century were enough for Ivan Petrovich. They were still are very modest, but are sufficient for it. Without having full clarity, being guided only by confidence that the world is incontestably material, it decided to begin the business. And it must be said, Even in very shy set of the facts and hypotheses Pavlov managed to make out everything that it was necessary to him: "before us the grandiose fact of development of the nature from an initial state in the form of fogs in infinite space, to the human being on our planet, in a look, roughly telling, phases: solar systems, planetary system, dead and live parts of the terrestrial nature".1 However, not all have the experimental experience of Ivan Petrovich allowing to see confirmation of natural bases of the universe in a drop of dog saliva. Approximately at the same time, i.e. at the beginning of the XX century there was also the first opportunity "to feel" the metaphysical idea. Own "flesh", any tangible contents at it it was not found.2 It was almost entirely made of ignorance, incomprehensibility and sophisticated romanticism. I.e. from the main construction materials of all other culture homo. But! All these components were surprisingly strong construction material. They were impregnable for any logic and are not subject the empiricist. All these components were surprisingly strong construction material, impregnable for any logic and not subject any the empiricist. We remember that attempts of estestvennik to bite to death the metaphysical idea in honest fight only covered debatable space with fragments of the academic teeth. The beginning of the twentieth century added such fragments. Why it happened? The matter is that the metaphysical idea quickly adapted to new reality. She learned to treat any misses and disagreements of science in own favor. It undoubtedly, was speculative, but very powerful reception. As we see, reception works, to this day. Its mechanism is simple: any blot or a defect of natural sciences right there appears the proof of existence certain"supernatural beginnings" world, everything that still did not receive the simple explanation always it is treated in favor of metaphysics. Here also the confusion with drawings of embryos of Gekkel, falseness of a pitldaunsky skull, lack of "transitional forms", mystique of a role of enzymes in formation of DNA or some quantum ambiguities is good. Inevitability of mistakes in accumulation and clarification of exact knowledge – obvious and natural business. But the metaphysics learned to stick to errors of science and to treat each of them as the personal victory. According to such logic, any hitch of the athlete acting on the arena has to add points to the bearing malice cripple on a twenty fifth row of stands who also does not participate in competitions. Situation, of course, amusing. But, strictly speaking, all this characterizes not metaphysics, and only metaphysicists.

"Twenty years' experience". As actually, priests of the tribe of Senufo, and also Hegel – Pascal – Heidegger also declared.

And they can be understood. For rescue of the idea they are ready to do anything. Their naive cunning with altering of oversights of science in proofs of God's life, in own way, is even charming. However, again there is no confidence that on these tricks they were authorized by directly "demiurge". The license signed with a deity, granting the right to speak from his name, to us nobody still from them did not show. We remember that in the first third of the 19th century some poet proclaimed that "darkness of the low truth the ennobling deception is more expensive me than us", and this principle became a core of parascientific disciplines. "The ennobling deception" dressed up in psychological and philosophic vestments, was shrouded in esoteric crapes, and headed deaf, persistent war against physiology. This eternal fight of beautiful "deception" has a talk with physiology the clear aspiration of the person to defend the advantage to keep in inviolability the myth about uniqueness homo in the universe. Today, years later, points in a life origin question, generally, are placed. Carefully, accurately and evidential. But! From that era when all also began in this subject metaphysics feelers are still stretched. They are living. They very sensitively innervate a subject and keep it live on the present minute.

No. 18
We finished last lecture that from that era in a subject of an origin of life metaphysics feelers are still stretched. They very sensitively innervate a question and keep its urgent on the present minute. We will be fair – only they and keep. No other movement in this area is observed several decades. Only when feelers start moving and begin to smother the next doctrine of natural sciences then also the science remembers days of former glory and though something cheeps in reply. it peep, it is necessary to tell, does not impress. Any serious she cannot show resistance, as if Pavlov, Bernal, Feynman, Watson, Shout and other giants carried away with themselves in graves all fire of knowledge, courage and conviction. Science at which it did not turn out to clear from dispersal the life origin question bar, at first confusedly it was blown off, and learned to get off "the main question" with tolerant phrases later. Why it occurred? The matter is that, by the end of the XX century the natural sciences warped and cracked under blows of a ram of culture. That beat without any respite, both fundamentals of science, and all it to graceful superstructures. The culture threw legions of poets, tenors, designers into fight and directors. As a result it won almost all positions lost in the 19th century. Having trampled on fragments of scientific outlook, the tenor was fixed again by a cult of geniuses, inexplicability of art, the world, love, and through it and metaphysics in pure form. Fine example – Richard Dawkins. Scientist, only remaining faithful to science and its outlook, appears the atheist and it is shown as certain экзот. The science was demoralized and prostrate. Left it at mankind only a role of the court conjurer, inventor of any pleasant "features", it seems moisture capacious laying, bombs and phones. To replace Pavlov and Shout, on the arena of eternal fight the generation of sluggish and impressionable associate professors crept.

From their lips babble about "creator", "soul", "demiurge" and a certain "highest force" which, most likely and became "the world prime cause" began to sound again. Completing grotesqueness of a picture, from all cracks, the grown bolder priests got again. However, business was not only in the attack of culture. And certainly, not in bottoms. Lack of scientific discipline which it is specialized became the most important reason of a new celebration of metaphysics over knowledge and purposefully dealt with a life origin issue. Yes, there is a biochemistry, biophysics, astrophysics, theoretical physics, a crystallography, a paleozoology, paleobotany, evolutionary genetics, comparative anatomy, molecular, theoretical and mathematical biology, physiology, geology, et cetera cosmology. Yes, each of these disciplines adjoins to our main question and offers on it the certain chamber answer which is strictly within the competence. But these answers are not switched in the uniform scientific phenomenon in any way. Why? Because service of each of these disciplines demands lifelong and fanatical concentration only on the subject also does not allow any derivations. It is impossible to imagine the character who could contain in himself at the same time and in all completeness at least physiology, structural geology and quantum mechanics.1 In a sense, the biochemistry and biophysics can "adjoin" for a while owing to interdependence, as well as geology to a paleozoology, but for a uniform and strong picture synthesis of one and all disciplines is necessary. Moreover, this synthesis has to be well it is protected and constantly we update. For each trifle opened by geneticists or paleobotanists in it immediately there has to be a critical judgment and the right place. Such scientific branch, alas, does not exist. No, certainly, and the character who could own all completeness of the mentioned knowledge. Let's repeat, each of them demands the whole life, fanatical obsession with one, at most two strictly special questions. So, the discipline does not exist, a certain titanic figure which would accumulate all knowledge having direct or indirect relation to a life origin, too not. But not everything is as nasty as it seems at first sight. Still there is a method which allows to choose their essence from all sciences, and having chosen, to put these essences in more or less reliable wide paradigm. It is a kartezianstvo. And what such kartezianstvo? It – first of all, ability "to skim off the cream". Let's explain. As we remember, in the XVII century in France realistic was demanded the doctrine which is clearing up a phenomenon2 human mind. This aspiration to clarity was natural. The fact of ability of the person to thinking already demanded a solution. The religious version almost lost the force, remaining convincing only for fanatics of belief whom there was less every year. And knowledge which accumulated for a set of centuries held apart society from within. There was a confidence that the mechanics of mind can be explained with same ease, as laws of optics or astronomy.

Certainly, the accumulated knowledge was the most different quality. But them was much and they burned reason, than today's scientific works much stronger. Today any, even sensational researches are perceived as something, self-evident and resulting from the general order of things. And in the XVII century science still was the revelation overturning life to anything who adjoined to it. It was time when "books were not read, and were learned by heart", and existence of knowledge could or cost much to their owner, or to become the reason of his eminence and improbable wellbeing. From our twenty first century the general volumes seem to scientific information of the sixteenth century insignificant. It is ridiculous illusion. They were truly huge. The astronomy of the 17th century was weaved from Ptolemaeus, Purbakh, Regiomontan, Toskanelli, Rinaldini, Copernicus, Bruno, Galilei's fancy mix, Braga, Kepler, Averroes, Aristotle, Archimedes, Aristarkh, Al-Fergani, Araabkhata, Varaamishra, Ulugbek and Nikolay Kuzansky's systems. Thousands of sound volumes comprised ideas of minerals, magnetism, metallurgical science, electricity, zoology, geography, botany, speed, refraction and the wave nature of light, optics, effect of color and electricity, of anatomy, medicine, logarithms, algebra, vacuum, reproduction of insects, mechanics, pyrotechnics, paleontology and ballistics. Let's remind that by then there were already Roger and Francis Bekonov, von Gerike, Agricola, Sturtevant, Gilbert, Kabeo, Gassendi, Torricelli, Yungius, Francesco Lang Tierqi, Huygens, Fermat, Grimaldi, Paracelsus, Marco Marcia, De Dominis, Kardanus, Telezio, Nunyets, Merkator, Miguel Servet, Garvey, Niccolo Zucchi, Ambroise Paré, Vezalius, Fallopiya, Sylvius, Van-Gelmonta, Remer, Svammerdam, Santorio's works, to Nehemiah Gr, John Ray, Mayo, Okkama, Duns Scott, Geber, Severus Sebokt, Tartalyi, Benedetti, Malpigiya, Simona Stevina, Friziusa, Snelliusa, Santorio, Gartmana, Bernard Palissi, Tartalyi, Benedetti, Biringuchcho, Toskanelli, Gössner, Rondele, Galen of et cetera. We listed only names of the first size now, but except them it is necessary to remember Mersenn, Arnold from Villeneuve, Muzian Ruff, Matthäus Silwatikus, Ulrich von Guttena, Pierre Beylia, Pietro Vergierio, Johann Christiaan Edelman, Abraham Sakuto, De Prada, Pietro D, Abana, Lorenzo Valla, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, Pietro Pomponazzi, Otto Brunfels, Johann Weier, Ulysses Aldrovandi, John Dee, Giuseppe Francesco Borja, Charles Estien, Geoffroi Vallée, Cecco D, Askoli, Viete, Frederiko Chezi, Ekkio, Franesko Stelutti.

Giacomo Berengario1 found and described a corpus striatum; Akhillini2 studied the first and fourth pairs of cranial nerves, i.e. olfactory and block nerves; Gabriel Fallopy3 still more precisely and in detail described the fourth couple and created a strong sketch of the ninth, i.e. a glossofaringeus. Besides, it laid the foundation of studying of anatomy of a labyrinth, a timpanichesky chord and a yazykoglotochny nerve; Fernelius4 created the description of the central channel of a spinal cord and a hypothesis of a role of nerves as transmitters of influence of a brain on muscles; Sylvius I5 found siringomiyelichesky cavities and topografirovat bark crinkles; Varoly6 described the bridge of a brain, leg and an optical nerve; Conrad Shneyner7 expressed a bark role, as the place of localization of memory, and about Moseto zhechka, as about the center of reflexes;8 Juan Guarte9 summarized some, very controversial and separate data on consequences of injuries of the head; Lorenz Fris,10 judging by its drawings in the little-known book "Mirror of the Doctor" carefully studied a hiazma and depth of bark; Thomas Eraste11 and Fernelius12 in silence of the laboratories investigated the epilepsy nature; Andreas Wesalius13 in the seventh book of the work "About a Structure of a Human Body" completely described and topografirovat a brain. Moreover sensational assumptions of possible functions of its numerous structures were stated to them. Certainly, we managed to remember only a small part of those who should have been remembered. But besides creators and collectors of exact knowledge of the world who all, in a varying degree, were derelicts there was also an official science of Vatican. It, by the way, was also considered as a real learning, and such as Bruno, Copernicus, Galilei and Vezaly had reputation of "freaks", the exotic heat-spots which swelled up on a noble nose of original knowledge. Copernicus not incidentally so long delayed publications of the opening, understanding that "De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestium Libri Sex" will be competently mocked and announced by a pseudo science. He wrote: "I am frightened by a thought of contempt because of novelty and differences of my theory".14 As it became clear a bit later, Copernicus appeared the rights. Its work for long time became subject not to the academic discussions, and only sneers. Many mocked at it. From authors of popular didactic poems and encyclopedias15 to science pillars.16

From the church point of view no special crime in Copernicus's work was observed. Father Lev X belonged to it it is ironic, but is very benevolent, and the pontifical curia supported him. In 1532 Copernicus's system was officially presented on readings in the Vatican gardens, and not someone, and personal secretary Fathers. By Kopernikanstvo in general it was perceived complacently until the situation was aggravated by Bruno who declared himself his faithful adherent. In the 16-17th century the scientific jealousy already existed. "Experts" were able to protect "possession" from any strangers. To acquire the right to vote in science, it was necessary to adjoin to corresponding to caste,1 certainly, completely dividing it views on all key questions. Also tactics of neutralization of the dissidents and strangers who illegally made the way in discipline was fulfilled. It was primitive, but it worked. The caste skillfully used tactical advantages of "height". She arranged the academic disorder of new views, and then surely lowered the assessment "the floor below" to belltto rist, press and intellectuals.2 Those, a little understanding in a question essence, but trusting to ranks and titles willingly began persecution, for few years turning practically any innovator into a laughing-stock. So repeated from century to century. To Copernicus, certainly, remembered that he is churchwarden, but in astronomy – the layman; Galilei was recommended to look in клистир, but not in the telescope, usKaya on his main profession.3 Periodically there were desperate characters who tried to break ridges and to caste, and to podpevala. If business reached open and persistent opposition, then firewood was used. As set Bruno's example, three there were enough woodpiles, as a rule, to stop the dispute which went too far. Members of the well-known academy "de of Linchei" were forced to communicate between themselves by means of codes for fear not before inquisition, and is exclusive before scientific community. I will remind that the duke Frederiko Chezi quite capable to protect was the informal head of academy it from church prosecution, but powerless before kafedrala of Rome of that time, Bologna and Florence. We make a mistake, razmezhyovyvy science of that time and church. It is incorrect. The church and science were a single whole. In the 17th century of official scientists, focused on providing a theological picture of the world, there were thousands. Each of them had an opportunity to be published, occupy departments of the best universities and to force to the knees everyones "Galilean". We can, of course, following tradition, to call them "skholasta", but this designation will be very conditional. Let's note that among "skholast" there were not only masters of beautiful charlatanism or podtasovshchik of the facts. Anything similar. In the majority it were absolutely conscientious researchers. Yes, they did not manage to overcome an attraction of "the Christian truth" and under it "bent and prepared" natural sciences. But they did it quite sincerely and selflessly. Listing to bright "skholast" of a century we are obliged to remember Fortinius Lyutsetus, Leon Allatius, Dzhyms Asher, Ludovico put to Colomba, Afanasy Kirkheriya et cetera. What did they become famous for?

Lyutsetus1 – the author of very influential concept of the fact that the Moon is almost entirely made of phosphorus, and effect it luminescences it is based on a phosphorescence. The most amusing that the hypothesis was based on extremely convincing experiments. Lyutsetus took the Bologna stone2 also made of it disks and hemispheres. Their luminescence was almost imperceptible in the afternoon, but at nightfall they brightly inflamed, gaining very realistic similarity to the Moon. On the basis of numerous experiences at which disks and hemispheres were observed at different distances, under different corners and in the conditions of different illumination, Lyutsetus with absolute confidence declared that the Moon has the phosphoric nature. As a result: The beauty and support on the natural phenomena the hypothesis made great impression on contemporaries, and Lyutsetus got glory of the most authoritative astronomer and scientist. Let's consider the second person involved from Nour list – Leon Allatius,3 Keeper of the Vatican Library. He created the charming theory according to which rings of Saturn consist of extreme flesh of Jesus Christ, risen after trimming. As a result: Took place4 two debates with participation of theologians and most of astronomers who solved a possibility of inclusion of this hypothesis in university courses. The third the hero is professor James Ashsher.5 On the basis of bible chronology he calculated day of creation of the world, i.e. on October 23 4004 BC. and thus established "very exact" age of the planet. As a result: Throughout long time this figure was considered only as the right and proved science. Why we list all this absurd? Creating volume and the most juicy idea of natural sciences of that time. And also to clear power and universality of that method that allowed to separate "sheep from козлищ" and to skim off originally scientific "cream" from all disciplines. Allatius, Bellarmini, Lyutsetus, Kirkhery and still one thousand6 had no "skholast" on title pages of the works of the special tags warning that their studying – waste of time. On the contrary as we already spoke – at that time it were very authoritative authors. Acquaintance with their volumes was obligatory. Of course, the science of the XVII century was phantasmagoric medley in which reasonable and exact intertwined with the wildest conjectures. Kepler's works adjoined with departed to Saturn preputsiy Christ, and the gross blunders of Kirkherius had the same weight, as Fermat's opening. Deepening in one and all then was so unreal, as well as today. Or still is more impossible. Today we have laws of natural sciences. Everything that contradicts them can be safely and is unconditionally rejected. We are mOsh not to take into account7 the flying prepution, psychotherapy or "extra corporal feelings". Then these reference points still were not formulated. Everything was much more difficult also zaputanny.

And it was fine, so, as soon as boundless and bottomless epistemological chaos of the 17th century could generate the figure capable this chaos to tame and order. According to the logic of development of science it by all means had to leave "foam of century". This "Aphrodite" was not slow to be. The professional soldier became her -mercenary, gambler, pirate and duelist René de Descartes. He is Kartezy or Kartezius since the academic rules of that time demanded from scientist to latinise a name. Its education was limited to Jesuit school in La Flesh where Descartes was trained in Latin, rudiments of simple mathematics, and also Jesuit logic. Having graduated from school, Descartes went to be at war. Certainly, not for native France, and for thalers and guldens. Under banners Maksimilian Bavarsky it took Prague, and under drums of prince Oransky of strappers of Arminians. In passing it wandered, kartyozhnichat, bryukhatit ladies and maidens, blasphemed, drank, pirated, smoked tobacco, dueled, i.e. conducted very much healthy lifestyle. Periodically Descartes was shut in a solitude and ground lenses. Or visited slaughters where studied pork hearts. However, not only hearts and not only pork. Let's remember the known example characterizing it as very impudent experimenter. Having made in a shutter at a window of the office an opening, Descartes fixed in it a svezhevynuty ox-eye, "looking outside". From a back wall of an eye it scratched out a layer of fabrics and had an opportunity "through an eye" to behold tiny, turned image of own yard. Its embryological occupations stand a separate mention too. "I forced to kill once a cow who as I knew, conceived recently, is exclusive with the purpose to examine it fruit".1 He never and anywhere taught, almost did not give lectures and in general avoided the academic environment. In particular, it is known that for the inexplicable reasons Descartes evaded from acquaintance even with Galilei. The days it finished at court of the Swedish queen Christina, having accepted the poisoned wafer from hands of the Jesuit Jacques Vioge as Jesus's award Kartezius's influence on the young queen began to irritate. Of course, it has more went fire, but sentimental Jesuits decided to manage fraternally with the graduate of school La Flesh and were limited to poison in a participle. What Vioge filled "a Christ's body" with was necessary to the unknown, but Descartes tormently died. Farther everything developed still more successfully: his compositions were introduced in INDEX LIBRORUM PROHIBITORUM, and the special decree of Louis XIV at all universities of France it was forbidden to remember even a name of Karteziya. Descartes's biography, certainly, cannot cause anything, except envy. Though on its exoticism partly Hawking with a side amyotrophic syndrome also outdid, nevertheless, René de Descartes's biography is reference to this day for scientist. First of all the fact that it is the biography of the person for whom bravery was a habit. However, it is not it. It is necessary to remind that we speak about the person, which from amazing ease turned and structured the European science.

He presented a method by means of which of any medley of knowledge it is possible to withdraw the most necessary and important, having eliminated trifles and excess details. Kartezy approved obvious: "all sciences are so connected among themselves that all is easier to study them at once, than any one of them separately from all others …».1 It"Reasoning on the method allowing to direct the mind and to find the truth in sciences" did not lose efficiency and today. Certain an inconvenience is given by archaism of style, but it overcoming is generously rewarded. Moreover, without application of a cartesian method of "removal of cream from all sciences" the attempt to understand a life origin is doomed to a total failure today. Not incidentally one of original authors of the theory of an abiogenesis John Berdon Sanderson Haldane,2 the founder of biochemical genetics, founded society of "Cartesians" and the first in the 20th century applied the methods of knowledge of the difficult phenomena developed by René Descartes. Specification is necessary. Under a kartezianstvo,3 not the philosophical system and the "duality of the world and the person" which was not seeming to Descartes in a haze of his century means. By no means. We speak only about Cartesian mechanics of thinking. About ability to defiantly join data of the most various sciences for obtaining answers to global questions. Kartezianstvo learns to go against all dogmas and scientific decencies. It is based on fearlessness, intrepidity and lack of authorities. In fact, this piracy. Of course, application of this method dooms to some superficiality, and at times and to amusing small mistakes. Concerning mistakes it is possible not to worry. If the idea has value, then in science there are enough cleaners which willingly will tidy up inevitable garbage. Of course, the kartezianstvo guarantees the conflict with "narrow experts", but these poor fellows should be understood and forgiven. Being, mainly, the eunuchs designed to protect and keep order in factual "harem", experts are also obliged to resist penetrations into it of any impudent fellows. Certainly, having found the stranger who got into "harem", eunuchs associate professors will surely lift exposing jealous shout. It will not be possible to pretend to be "one of them". It is possible even not to try. Even if actor's abilities will be enough for imitation of their mimicry and the speech, all the same, sooner or later, there will come the moment "to remove wide trousers". Tutto all will also open. So it is better to work defiantly and surely at once, without paying attention to indignation. Having thoroughly plaid pranks in "harem" with the most beautiful ideas and having filled the pockets with the precious facts, finally it is necessary to take leave politely. Then it is necessary to admire dedication of the eunuchs keepers spending the life for protection and wellbeing of "harem". After that, "having made ручwhich", it is possible to jump out of a window.4 So small problem is also so-called "superficiality". Certainly, it is very conditional and "superficiality" can be called with a big stretch. But!

One business to create and develop scientific discipline, another – to use it and to remove with it "cream". Of course, it is absolutely different levels. The first demands absolute depth and sacrifices, detailed comprehension of all nuances. The second – only the structured sober acquaintance to it.

No. 19
Let's bring the simplest example of superficiality, admissible for the solution of those tasks that we delivered to ourselves. Speaking about a life origin, it is difficult not to touch a question of geological "development" of this or that planet. What is the elementary indicator of such development? Certainly, first of all, this variety of mineral structure it bark. What can minerals tell of that planetary body where they appeared? A lot of things. Knowing approximate amount of minerals and that chemism which generates them, it is possible to outline easily and almost unmistakably planet "portrait" from the moment it educations up to now. Existence or lack of sulfates, arsenates, borat, chlorides, fluorides, carbonaceous connections and nitrates gives accurate idea of a volcanism, relief, existence and type of liquid water, temperatures, age, magnetism, radioactivity, weight and even about the angular speed of axial rotation of the planet during the different periods. It is known that than the speed of axial rotation, especially is more onlogy is the general relief.1 And the vypolazhivaniye changes a mineralogical portrait of the top layer of the planet a little. Certainly, to speak about minerals, it is necessary distinctly to imagine their evolution. It, as well as all other, began at the time of emergence of the Universe. Now we pronounced fatal words. We opened a chasm, teeming astrophysical and cosmological theories. The chasm is picturesque, boundless and seductive. Let's note that to us in it it is not necessary. Moreover quietly to discuss a question of an origin of minerals, we need to evade from participation in infinite speculation about the general origin of matter. We need to build only in the necessary order those facts that today look as rather indisputable. For this purpose it is necessary to remember manual of the next Cartesian, professor A. D. Speransky, the favourite pupil Ivan Petrovich. "In order that the motionless group of the separate facts got life, it is not required to add by all means in it some number of the new facts. It is necessary only to connect the facts in dynamic system. If it is reached in relation to chaotic group of the unused facts, then and equally well it is possible to arrive also with the old material which was already a part of these or those combinations because the facts have no independent and isolated value." Now we should make very difficult maneuver. To make the way to our minerals, we should slip between furiously fighting monsters of the main hypotheses of cosmology. The main danger consists in demonic charm of theoretical physics and astrophysics. They suck in and devour without the rest even those who it is simple goes by them on the affairs. Not to mention madmen who decided to arrange surfing on the flaring waves of theories the Universe origin.

As our task is much more modest, than critical judgment of "the beginning of the beginnings", we let's take for a basis so-called. "standard Model" which is, standard in modern astronomy and astrophysics. Standard Model has indirect, but strong confirmation in the fundamental equation of Friedman, works on Weinberg, Hubble, Sagan and Hawking's cosmology. So, withthe perv was not nothing. Neither time, nor space, nor matter. In it "nothing" there was a certain explosion. It usually call "Big" and with it, in principle, it is possible to agree. At least because definition "Small" obviously does not approach it. "Then in a flash there was not just something, and everything that should exist, and all at once. At this moment volume AllLena was less atomic nucleus".1 To doubt the fact of some explosion not to have. since the relic radiation of Hubble really proves that all matter and energy of the Universe received at some point sharp and essential acceleration which force does not weaken also about the present minute. Proportionality of speed of removal of rather close galaxies to distance to them. Coefficient proportionality is called Hubble's constant. Everything really scattered and continues to scatter. It is easy to be convinced of it and independently, having compared observable and absolute to luminosity stars or having looked at the known theorem of Birgkof. But! Cosmology did today everything possible that the origin of the Big Bang became completely inexplicable. Explosion appears as the devil from a snuffbox. For no reason at all and without the slightest need. Certainly, as a makeweight the version about a certain point of singularity also is attached to Standard Model. Having applied it to a hypothesis of the Big Bang, an opportunity everything appears finally to confuse and make senseless. Let's formulate it, relying on Hawking, Krauss, Hazen, Potter, Hubble's known works, Hoil, Weinberg and Sagan. So, tpoint of singularity was when nothing still was not and could not be. Though nothing was, everything already was and "everything" was located in superdense volume неустановимо small size. In spite of the fact that everything already was, nothing was, including the size and even "point". However, in spite of the fact that it was not, it was and even managed to shandarakhnut so that matter, and also all holes and shreds of time still scatter from a point in which they never were. The singular version, of course, fascinates by absurdity to which even fathers of church would envy. Explosion was and remains the weakest point of cosmology and astrophysics. However, from it smells not of god, and simple backwardness of science, pardonable for a wildish 21st century. Perhaps, through couple of centuries singularity and the version"devil from a snuffbox" will amuse cosmologists approximately the same as today amuses us "Christ's prepution" in interpretation of professor Leo Allatius. Fatly let's emphasize: we doubt not the fact of the Big Bang, and its bezrodnost. That it was not preceded by a long chain of quantum and kvarkovy cosmological events. Yes, we do not know them so far and we cannot even dream in their occasion. But they, undoubtedly, took place since. Explosion has all characteristics very difficult, multicomponent and, if I may say so, very "developed" event. The relation to Explosion as by "the beginning of the beginnings" it is as ridiculous how the announcement, for example, an antrakozavra a point counting any land life.

I will explain. Let's assume, our paleontologic finds would be огranichena only protogerinusy,1 very nice yashcherovidny being of the Carboniferous Period. Really, certain part of terrestrial fauna conducts the sort from it. Antrakozavr had withwe howl evolutionary continuation2 and zverozuby pangolins терапсид, and to them the evolutionary lot had to give life to mammals. And here all those who preceded an antrakozavr, we still did not find and would not have about them any concept. We would have no qualifiers according to which our protopangolin was preceded by akantosteg, ikhtiosteg, latimeriya and so forth. We would not know these names and would not be lucky enough to touch skeletons of these beings. Certainly, we would have no ideas and of his earlier ancestors: about trilobita, anomalokarisa and pulpy organisms of the Ediacaran Period. At us would be only протогеринус. Magnificent, but lonely. To it the name "singular" very went. Nevertheless, morphological complexity and development of our pangolin would never allow us to consider that "all and began with him". For one simple reason we are able to notice very essential difference between protogerinusy and late reptiles, his lineal descendants. Having compared our "singular" pangolin with dimetrodony, and then and with still more developed sinapsida, we will see all signs of the continuing improvement of a brain, an organism, functions and morphology. These signs of undoubted development oblige us to assume "up" that the return is necessary and" counting". From an antrakozavr down, to simpler individuals. Before us there would be a task to look for and find them. Approximately the same story and with the Big Bang. There is no slightest opportunity to assume that in a cosmological chain it was the "first" event that it was generated by the certain mystical singularity which does not have explanations. Most likely, Explosion was preceded by a long chain of the phenomena which, perhaps, will become sometime known to astrophysics. Explosion will stop being "orphan", it will have not only the factors which generated it, but also obvious reasons. Singularity will be or is handed over in archive, or will receive distinct explanations. Perhaps, nevertheless the hypothesis of "quantum foam" will be the most perspective direction of search. Or rather, that it part where by S. Bilson-Thompson it is suggested about an opportunity subcomponents elementrny particles to self-organization.3 As our way to minerals lies through grandiose stages of space history, to us it is necessary to specify still one moment. The matter is that we cannot go on a lead even if it was weaved for us by Sagan or Veynberg. Let's return to Explosion. The essence of working theories comes down to the fact that 13,7 billion years ago protoenergy left an event point. But to leave from it, протоэthe nergiya had to be substantiated.4

The astrophysics speaks about one such event. But, according to the logic of things, such attempts1 there had to be quadrillions. Only that attempt where "natural selection" where there was, at last, a way of objectification worked and became the beginning of the Universe. This way was the necessary proportion of weak and strong nuclear interactions, and also gravitation and electromagnetic forces. Then, on all beliefyatnost, there was also the fifth factor,2 which gave strength some maneuver also allowed to work, at last, to their mechanisms. Unsuccessful attempts of creation of the Universe in which protoenergy remained in itself, powerless to leave "quantum bubble", most likely, there was an incalculable set. Perhaps, the embarrassment happened a bit later when an exit occurred, but the incorrect balance of forces did not allow protomatter to gain the necessary power of the movement and temperature. Then everything died, having hardly been born. We repeatedly on all, without exceptionй, examples were convinced that everything in the nature comes true as a result of sekstillion of "tests and mistakes" and only as a result of gradual evolutionary development and laborious selection of the working scheme. The moment of good luck is caused by inevitable accident. It inevitability is caused by unlimited plurality of "experiments" and a tendency of matter to self-organization. It explains all riddles of "the first moments". Both the accuracy of the picked-up temperature, and the guessed speed of expansion of space. And partly supersymmetry. At one of evolution stages nothing is impossible from "the first time", and the beautiful principle"devil from a snuffbox" never works. We have no slightest bases to assume, as the Big Bang had some other origin, than any other natural phenomenon, subordinated to four to forces.3 Of course, its solution – in its stories. But it is closed from us so far. However, let astrophysicists since it has very few relation to an origin of minerals deal with it. The quantum theory of the field assumes growth of an initial quantum bubble till 10-27 degree that, in principle, it is enough that in it occurred the first process which demanded some "time", i.e. a special type of space for a possibility of consecutive actions of forces." Best of all Einstein told about it: "Time exists in order that everything did not happen at the same time". What still "forces" and factors, except these, then were used, but were rejected by the protoenergy which is torn from the point as inefficient for the decision it is concrete this problem, we it is probable, we find not out soon. With some of them we, perhaps, meet in the quantum world, but we" do not "greet" as "are not familiar", and for their approximate designation in our language there are neither words, nor terms, nor concepts. Let's try to explain still more it is clear. On still simpler example. History of the Big Bang4 very much remotely reminds the epic of emergence of deoxyribonucleic acid. The Big Bang once gave life of barionny matter and to space thanks to what the Universe appeared with it quasars, pulsars and other attributes of space.

Everything was more difficult, than it was represented during the first several moments when "Superdense space appeared in the form of net uniform energy and any particles did not break its absolute uniformity". Educations became result of this beautiful picture, alas stars and planets, gravitational robbery of black holes and Hawking's carriage. Approximately the same story only in smaller scales repeated also with DNA. DNA once generated organic chemistry, having shown surprising dexterity in the treatment of amino acids. Most likely, for this purpose at it wasand certain deeply personal reasons.1 But the evolutionary mechanism suddenly started working, and DNA became the commander-in-chief very specific life form, fateful it is eternal to build of amino acids of a squirrel, of cage proteins, and of cages organisms. But until, when "DNA" received the gold epaulets, it was only deoxyribonucleic acid, one of many acids which appeared on Earth as a result of initial chemism. History it nothing mysterious contains emergence or extraordinary. It, of course, the highmolecular, but not too difficult arranged connection of derivatives of a ribose and phosphoric acids. That first era that is called Gadeysky eony, produced such acids great variety. However, at withAmoy of nucleinic acid2 there is very romantic detail of the biography. In some meteorites which arrived to Earth from deep space over the last 50 years glycoaldehyde was found. Through a chain of simple reactions it turns into a ribose, key ингредиент ribonucleic acid.3 During removal from it one atom of RNA oxygen easily turns into DNA. However, deoxyribonucleic acid had no special need for a space origin. She was doomed to appear also as a result of natural processes on early Earth. We remember that during an era it the births all elements had an every second opportunity to enter between itself any reactions. Gadeysky эон was time the place of a great chemical orgy which, alas, will nevermore repeat. All planet was uniform laboratory, equipped retorts of thousands of volcanoes, extractors hydra and geothermal sources, and also all types of natural reactors, dephlegmators, distillers, refrigerators and evaporators. Yes, all this partly remained to this day, but intensity of consecutive chemical coitions, then was in millions times more, than today. And in as much time is more effective. Why we decide to approve it? First, because and "to stultify ubiquitous free oxygen which is able to popachkat through oxidation" any experiment, still did not receive on power Earth. It simply then was not. Respectively and no protective ozone layer existed too. There was a juicy mix of radioactive vapors and heated gases, taken and withheld by gravitation of Earth, and all types of tousleichesky radiation created with it4 everything that wanted. Secondly, because the palette of power impacts on elements and their communications was much richer. It included all types of radiations, explosive and digit energy, any kinds of heatings, coolings and pressure. As we already established, nothing interfered with short-wave ultraviolet and meteoric rains to burn down, irradiate and bombard the planet. Radioactivity early Gays was a madwoman. During that time all radioactive elements were young, full of strength and did not even think about any disintegrations or half-decays.

On the most rough to calculations thorium was one quarter more, than now, and the 238 and 235 uranium – three times. Soderzhaniе transuranium elements1 could reach 1% in certain places. From a subsoil went heated hydrogen, involving transuraniums in local thermonuclear reactions, and explosive and vulgar outpourings of lavas from volcanoes lifted upward and radiogenic argon which added a piquancy to this picture. Also it is necessary to mention that значительнabout also electrodigit was higher2 the activity attacking in millions of volts infernal mix of free hydrogen, hydrogen sulfide, carbonic acid, vapors of sulfur, chlorine, fluorine and water. In this cocktail were condensed and transmutirovat the acids which were dropping out rains, covering everything with oxides. On oxides clouds of the space dust filled with all types of crystallites and molecules were besieged heavy elements. Blows of asteroids and meteorites provided infinite explosions, concussions, shock waves, breaks of thin bark and splashes in temperatures. Besides, asteroids brought in themselves on the planet all new and new elements. Those that were born only in deep space, at explosions stars. Let's remind that intensity of meteoric bombings in hundreds of times exceeded today's as Solar System still it did not develop finally, and space was overflowed with waste of a planetoobrazovaniye. Millions of square kilometers of jet chemical masses were pressed, loosened, again were baked and cooled down. Cocktails of radioactive vapors and gases heated them again, and volcanoes flooded with deep magma and filled up with extremely substantial fine ashes provoking thin reactions. Volcanic пеплы and ashes, as we know, are rich3 nitrogen that in combination with the mass of other factors could not but just start synthesis of nitrogenous connections. The sun, came nearer, moved away. According to it also force of its gravitational impact on Earth fluctuated, slowing down, accelerating speed it rotations. From it motions then began still absolutely thin bark formed in the course of initial cooling of an external layer of the planet. Bark stretched, burst and dybitsya, releasing magmatic waves and diapirs from depths. Breaks were formed. And in them collapsed acid-water oceans, advanced to be condensed at a surface. It besides caused steam explosions in hundreds of kilometers long and improbable combinations, and recombinations of elements. Perhaps, during this period those phosphoric acids which were so necessary for DNA creation were formed. On zones of breaks there was also a decontamination of the top cloak saturating primary atmosphere with hexafluoride of sulfur, uranium, tungsten, and also mercury vapors. In a step to rotation failures, as always, earthquakes were activated. They mixed water lenses and underground sources with the melted magmatic layers. Everything blew up, alloyed and mixed up again, still more enriching concentration of reagents and facilitating them communications. But the union was the most important and unique factor of the Gadeysky eon, most likely branched chain chemical and chain nuclear reactions. Thanks to it substance could pass all imaginable stages of the changes. Certainly, when finding a certain optimum form it "stopped" as silicon and oxygen "stopped" in a crystal of met quartz. All magnificence of processes cannot be described as it is impossible and to give an idea of their scale. But it is important to understand that in nuclear and chemical transmutations, during one billion years each microgram of a huge planetary body every second participated.

Certainly, we speak only about regular, rather quiet situations now. Everything that occurred at the moments of separation of the Moon from Earth or at blows in it especially large bodies, was still more picturesquely. In particular, R. Hazen believes that the gravitational force of the Moon which was originally from Earth in only 24.000 km. it was demonic big. Under it influence "each several hours the melted magma on the Earth's surface swelled huge waves more than a kilometer high". Now, having some idea of power of laboratory in which it was required only to oxidize several phosphates and through power influences to receive a ribose, and then through simple Nglikozidnuyu to unite communication phosphoric acid with ribose derivatives in a polynucleotide, to us not it is necessary to doubt that process was not too difficult though long and dreary. Deoxyribonucleic acid loses reputation "difficult" when we consider it components. Let's take for an example Purin. Its molecule consists of five atoms of carbon, four atoms of nitrogen and four hydrogen atoms. Artur Kornberg, of course, synthesized DNA in laboratory. To it not it was required one billion years, earthquakes. Hits in its laboratory of especially large meteorites. But it took already developed elements. We have too many examples educations of the chemical compounds which happened during this period and surpassing DNA by complexity. Perhaps, it took not less than half a billion years of continuous search of that final substratum which already had chemical integrity and could enter effective reactions. In principle we do not need even a "space" ribose, brought from unknown areas of a galaxy, though for secure we and it we keep in mind. As a result of an infinite set of these geochemical events, at some point met together and were distributed, at last, in the necessary proportsAI adenine-timin-guanine-tsitozin.1 Deoxyribonucleic acid appeared and began to function. We have the right to assume, as initial objectification, was very boring process. But so was only in the beginning, during an era of "quantum foam", i.e. those uncountable puzyryochok, one of which, actually, the Universe was also delivered. Further everything developed more vividly. Protoenergiya at last escaped from a point and gained lines of energy already in more clear sense of this word. Each subsequent step2 it was always dictated by momentary need and it was always caused by a certain concrete reason. All of them are in a varying degree found, but we will stop on most important and the simplest. It that energy, having appeared "mikst" in the power from nuclear interactions, gravitation, electromagnetism and time any in any other manner to behave also could not. Yes, "микст"3 still it developed and formed.4 But its integrative power did not leave any choice for young matter. "Микст" operated the environment which generated it more and more surely and despotichny. However, and energy did not come off the loser too. She received that she wanted. Most likely, it was so-called "development", i.e. a possibility of boundless distribution which consequence emergence of space turned out to be.

As a result of all these events so-called "quark-glyuonnaya" the plasma consisting of all types of quanta, quarks, bosons, gluons etc. was almost instantly formed. Certainly, any elements and the whole atoms as a part of plasma still was not, but "forces" began to build badly operated quantum particles in something more solidly at once. In what would be completely it obediently. It was business not difficult. It was required to lock only a part of quarks in protons and neutrons, to stick together a kernel and to fasten to it electrons. Then strong nuclear interaction for the first time had an opportunity to properly warm up and gain professional skills. However, these processes so beautifully opiumthe quantum chromodynamics syvat,1 what to add to Feynman, Altarelli or Indurayn though something brand new is not possible yet. As a result the first atom was born. It was lung, pro-wallsky, but the most important, it is already2 it was completely determined by forces. In passing, as cosmology testifies, there was a set of very important events: formation of antimatter, supersymmetry and decrease in subjectsператур from "Planck's temperature"3 to 1027.4 But concerning supersymmetry, anti-matter, dark matter and energy, and also "temperature hours" of formation of the Universe let astrophysicists butt further. We will not give ourselves to involve in it as all this is not too essential to a question of an origin of minerals. So or otherwise, but at our "generals"5 appeared first "soldier"6 capable to execute orders. Quantum anarchy, gameechno, anywhere did not get to, but it7 moved to "soldier" and by rough analogy it can be assimilated to the cellular and intercellular processes packed into a soldier's organism. They, of course, are powerful and can interfere with performance of the general order, but can not prevent. For example, these processes can force the soldier to prefer sitting on a pot to participation in a parade. It, of course, is possible, but on a statistical picture as history of a look homo shows, not really and influences. Parades are held regularly. So, there was the first atom. Though this event was not celebrated by a banquet, but owing to the known reasons we can consider this moment the official beginning of process of the general эvolyution barionny8 matters.9 However, hydrogen was not absolutely lonely. Small percent of lump of young substance occupied atoms of helium, a deuterium, and apparently, a lity. It was already almost visible objectification. Again earned forces which integrated objects of the influence again. There were first, molecules, very simple on the design. After a while clouded a part of space gas and molecular fogs.

spheres from turbulent gas1 sentenced the cyclopean masses to a role of infinite nuclear explosion. However, there comes the moment when such star, having burned a hydrogen reserve, turns into the red giant and helium begins to burn already. This burning allows to be formed to kernels of carbon and oxygen. Then there is an emergence more and more heavy elements, carbon burns, producing neon, magnesium and still it is more than oxygen. Reactions change again, already neogenic elements enter interactions. But in the same time gravitational force continues to work, bringing atoms and electrons to a spressovanost limit. Then works Paulie's principle. The latest processes produce already iron atoms. If such flaring piece quickly to sort and survey, then in it it is already possible to find2 still set of various elements, including sulfur, magnesium, silicon and nitrogen. Everything comes to an end with explosion. To general pleasure everything blows up to devil's mothers also fills the Universe with new elements already in the form of clouds. A bit later interaction four main forces created from gazovopylevy3 clouds space bodies. We know that the lithosphere of Earth consists of several thousand various minerals. Their most part has own thingness and tangibility. Smaller is present at a type of the separate atoms and molecules interspersed in other substrata or breeds. Tangible4 minerals are subdivided on the origin on sedimentary, hydrothermal and magmatic. Here it is very important not to plunge into the tyagomotneyshy bog of the academic disputes between schools of sciences which calculate and classify these minerals a little differently. Yes, this "bog" is delightful, but it contains several hundreds of volumes and consists of arguments and counterarguments of the Soviet, American and European schools. Soviet aster- the geology where the shadow of professor Katterfeld still reigns recognizes "stable" only 2.000 minerals of Earth, the author of the theory "mineral evolution" Robert Hazen considers those not less than 3.700, and the planetologist Andy Noul defends absolutely other figures. At desire we can gather still about 30 opinions in this occasion clashing between themselves, but looking quite academic and reasonably. All the matter is that Katterfeld considers only "chemically pure" the minerals formed in Dobiologichesky period of the planet, and5 Hazen recognizes as minerals and those that were formed under the influence of the arisen organic life form. Also data on amount of minerals on the Moon and Mars are categorically broken a set between themselves. Katterfeld believes that we with confidence can speak only about 89 lunar minerals. Partly it is fair since in those 400 kilograms of lunar soil that it was brought to Apollonami to terrestrial laboratories, there is so much them. The American astrogeology estimates the mineral capacity of the Moon slightly more generously. The same story with Mars.6 Knowing these figures and that chemism which generates minerals, combining elements in different conditions, it is possible to outline easily and almost unmistakably planet "portrait" from the moment it educations up to now.

Through these, very simple data we gain an impression about a volcanism, a relief, availability of liquid water, temperatures, age, magnetism, radioactivity, weight and even about the angular speed of its axial rotation during the different periods. It is known that than the speed of axial rotation, especially is more onlogy is the general relief.1 And the vypolazhivaniye changes a mineralogical portrait of the top layer of the planet a little. The essential share of borat and fluorides prompts to us that mountains are rather recent land acquisition. Therefore, once the speed of axial rotation was much more. We understand that terrestrial days proceeded 4–6-8 hours, the relief was flat, and respectively, the seas small and hot. These conclusions add picturesque details. Of course, to render a verdict about development or not development of a space body, it will be required to us for comparison still several planetary objects2 same type, as Earth. Let's take well studied Moon. In those 400 kilograms it soil that was brought to Apollonami to terrestrial laboratories, we will see only 89 minerals. Let's assume the generous assumption that they are three times more, than it was succeeded to collect. But mineralogical development of Earth and the Moon all the same will remain incomparable. Approximately history with Mars where basalt, an andesite, dacite, field spars is found will be same, but there is neither quartz, nor mica. Careful assumptions of structure of Io and Enceladus characterize their mineralogical development as very average, in comparison with Earth. All this will grant to us the right to operate already surely with the concepts "development" concerning such superdifficult bodies as planets and to draw necessary analogies. Of course, listed by us is hardly only one hundred-thousandth that knowledge which the science about space objects has. We showed shocking levity now, having told of interrelations of minerals and development of a planetary body. It should have been done through three-dimensional charts, calculations of their heliocentric distance from planetary bodies and "laws of content of silicates depending on their proximity to the Sun". In aster- Katterfeld's geology of value of weight, the size, density and a volcanism of the planet 6х1022 kg, Dk=3.300 km, dk = 3,25 g/sm will be defined by formulas Mk =. In evolutionary mineralogy which is nowadays brilliantly represented by professor Hazen to the same conclusions others need to go absolutely in the way. The origin of minerals can be determined by Vernadsky or Shopfu. It is possible to be guided by Breyzer or Hazen. These are the clashing schools. They see processes of a mineralotvoreniye a little differently. Certainly, all these nuances will be superbasic for planetologists. But they are absolutely indifferent for us. We skimmed off "cream". We bought the tool allowing to apply a concept to the selforganized very daunting structures "development – not development".3 In well developed science conclusions and formulations, as a rule, so are distinct, that they can be transferred without any distortions to Cartesian "fabric" of generalizations. The cartesian method allows to operate with data from any disciplines, having almost completely exempted from them.

As planetologists are expressed, it vypolazhivatsya. Approximately. 3 A bit later it very much is required to us.

Finishing this lecture follows still to remember time слова Cartesian Peter Medavar1 and its brilliant formulation: "As the science progresses, the concrete facts are absorbed by it, and, somewhat, disappear in the general statements of the increasing explaining force. We do not need to imagine in an explicit form all volume of the facts any more. In all sciences we are gradually exempted from freight of single examples, from tyranny concrete".
